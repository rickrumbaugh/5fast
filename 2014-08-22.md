#### Samsung will make a business in the IoT by making devices, acquiring air conditioner seller [Quietside](http://investorplace.com/2014/08/internet-of-things-samsung-quietside/) and promising startup [SmartThings](http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2014/0815/Samsung-buys-SmartThings-diving-deeper-into-the-Internet-of-Things)
Samsung is looking to create interconnected networks within houses that allow you to control household appliances with your smartphone. The company said in a statement that the 
acquisition of Quietside is a key one because air conditioners are essential household appliances.     
Allowing users to connect devices like lights and door locks to their mobile devices, SmartThings also runs an online platform for developers to create new designs for devices to connect 
with each other and be controlled through smart phone apps – much the way developers already create new apps for smart phones.

#### [But it also seems like there is a business in solving this problem: The IoT is overwhelming IT networks](http://www.baselinemag.com/networking/slideshows/internet-of-things-is-overwhelming-it-networks.html)
By 2020, the Internet of things (IoT) is expected to interconnect 26 billion computing devices in businesses, homes, cars, clothes, animals and pretty much everything else, 
according to Gartner. That's a thirtyfold increase over the past five years. While the potential for innovation is exciting, it's taking a toll on IT resources, according to survey 
research from Infoblox. Many tech professionals surveyed said that any required deployments for the IoT will become part of their existing IT network, even though most said 
their network is already at capacity. It doesn't help, findings reveal, that the business side often does not keep the IT organization informed about their IoT-related projects. 
"It's encouraging that IT professionals recognize the demands the Internet of things will make on their networks," says Cricket Liu, chief infrastructure officer at Infoblox. 
"But business units often get deep into the buying process before calling IT, sometimes forcing IT to scramble to provide support for devices that lack the full set of connectivity 
and security protocols found in established categories such as PCs, tablets and smart phones." On the positive side, IT employees feel their companies are committed to 
providing the budget and staffing needed to accommodate IoT-related demands. A total of 400 IT professionals from the United States and the United Kingdom 
took part in the research.

#### [Parking tickets are part of the cost of serving the "instant gratification" economy](http://recode.net/2014/08/06/can-instant-become-a-viable-business/)
As startups square up to take on the giants of delivery to bring customers their packages, groceries, food and services on the same day they’re ordered, they don’t 
necessarily need traditional infrastructure — warehouses, vehicle fleets, even employees.     
Unless they want to burn through hundreds of millions of dollars, like online grocer Webvan and on-demand deliverer Kozmo did in the dot-com era, they’ve got to think smarter.     
Redefining delivery for a new era of customers who want everything right away requires rethinking operations. By focusing attention on creating a powerful logistical system, 
and tying into the “sharing economy,” many of the new crop of startups in the on-demand space are trying to offer faster service at a much lower operational cost.

#### [Glad this would never happen where I work: Nobody is paying attention to your  conference call](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/study-nobody-is-paying-attention-to-you-on-conference-calls/378912/)

But even the executive that stands to benefit the most from our conferencing addiction says that it is killing our productivity. Rob Bellmar, Intercall's executive vice president of conferencing 
and collaboration, told Harvard Business Review that the fault is not in our attention spans, but in our approach to work. "Part of the problem comes from too many 
meetings," he said. "This leads people to confuse activity with productivity." In three separate surveys, managers said that between 25 and 50 percent of their time 
in meetings was a waste of time. A large review of studies on meeting productivity similarly found that meetings, although critical to workflow across many industries, 
repeatedly tested as being net drains to productivity. One 1982 study found that mid-level managers spend the equivalent of one full year of their full working-and-non-working 
life in meetings.
