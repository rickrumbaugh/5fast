#### [Boeing's simmering confrontation with its older workers gets hotter](http://crosscut.com/2014/08/12/business/121429/boeing-layoffs-speea-age-discrimination-complaint/)
“Diversifying our engineering workforce reflects changes in our business and is not related to the age of our employees,” Boeing said in an emailed statement.     
That’s not how workers see it. During the implementation of 2,500 layoffs in the past year, a handful of whistleblowing managers alerted the Society of Professional Engineering 
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) of possible bias, according to Roy Goforth, executive director of the union. In addition to those layoffs, the company announced in April that it 
will be laying off another 1,000 people in the Puget Sound area by the end of 2015 as part of a shift of some engineering work to Southern California.

#### [Robotics facility in support of 777X to be outfitted with standard Boeing infrastructure](http://www.industrytap.com/kuka-aerospace-open-29000-square-foot-facility-next-boeing-everett/22343)
Kuka Aerospace announced that it is opening a brand new 29,000 square foot facility in Everett, Washington, only the second United States location for the German robot giant.     
The new facility will mostly be used for service and maintenance and will be located right next to Boeing’s facility.     
Currently, Kuka and Boeing are working together on a project known as Fuselage Automated Upright Build or FAUB, which allows for more efficient manufacturing of 777X aircraft by 
using robots to install the fuselage’s approximately 60,000 fasteners, instead of manually by hand.     
Elizabeth Lund, Boeing Vice President and General Manager of the 777 program and Everett site, said, “This is the first time such technology will be used by Boeing to manufacture 
widebody commercial airplanes and the 777 program is leading the way.”

#### [There's a new surge in delivery service startups.  One thing in common is they leave the logistics to someone else](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html)
In the tech crash of the early 2000s, on-demand delivery services like Kozmo and Webvan weren’t just among the most colossal failures. They also became a sort of grim joke, 
symbolizing the excess that portended the bust. Afterward, conventional wisdom hardened: Web-enabled delivery was not a good business because it simply cost too much to build 
warehouses, manage an inventory and pay drivers. There was too little opportunity to recoup expenditures in delivery fees; people will pay only so much for toilet paper to be delivered 
before they decide to fetch it themselves.     
But something is in the air of late, making hindsight blurry. Despite the early demise of Rewinery and the shrunken ambitions of others, such as eBay Now, similar start-ups with names 
like Caviar, SpoonRocket and DoorDash have raised half a billion dollars in investment in the last year, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital. Even Louis Borders, 
the founder of Webvan (as well as the Borders bookstore chain, another Internet casualty), is at work on a grocery delivery start-up. Uber is using the $1.4 billion it just raised to expand 
beyond delivering people to delivering things. Meanwhile, venture capitalists joke that every other entrepreneur they meet pitches an “Uber for X,” bringing goods and services on 
demand: laundry (Washio), ice cream (Ice Cream Life), marijuana (Eaze) and so on. Investors are stuck wondering whether this is 2000 all over again, or whether this new breed of 
delivery start-ups can succeed where the last crop so famously failed.

#### [Analysts praise latest Cisco job cuts](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2014/08/20/analysts-praise-latest-cisco-job-cuts-as-needed-stage-in-smart-migration-strategy/)
SiliconANGLE founder John Furrier sees the latest reductions as a proactive step towards driving long-term growth rather than an act of desperation. ”Cisco is retooling for the 
converged-infrastructure-meets-cloud game where they are behind, yet have a huge installed base to transform.  This will require a step back for a big step forward,” Furrier said. 
“Cisco hasn’t had the massive brain drain other companies have had, so analysts think they are well-positioned for growth.”     
Wikibon analyst Stu Miniman agreed that the firm is not maneuvering around any immediate icebergs. “Cisco is a big company with many different businesses,” he noted. 
“Yes, things like SDN are important and have potential to disrupt Cisco’s dominant position in switching, but it’s still very early for this to have any direct impact on employment.”

#### ["I am Hari Seldon!"  If you know who that is, then you must also appreciate that Asimov's predictions in 1964 look pretty good 50 years later](http://topinfopost.com/2013/08/29/isaac-asimovs-1964-predictions-about-2014-are-frighteningly-accurate)
In 1964, famed science fiction writer Isaac Asimov ventured a guess at what you might find if you set foot inside the 2014 World’s Fair. Using his gift for envisioning future technology, 
Asimov’s predictions from 50 years out are both stunningly accurate and perhaps a little bit depressing. Here’s a look at what he got right.
