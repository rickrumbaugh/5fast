The healthy crop of new airliner orders announced by Boeing during July’s Farnborough International Air Show made a big impact on U.S. trade figures. New Department of Commerce 
data on manufactured durable goods revealed that orders announced at the biennial show for at least 228 new Boeing aircraft saw total orders in this sector rise by 22.6 percent in 
July to total $300.1 billion. Economists had predicted a rise of around 8 percent, suggesting that they had not anticipated the full extent of the Farnborough show boost.     
U.S. engine makers, most notably GE Aviation, also achieved strong sales at the Farnborough show.

Boeing hopes that the CST-100 will also be a leader in commercial space flight.     
"We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior," 
says Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for CCiCap.     
The age of commercial space flight began in 2012 when SpaceX's Dragon capsule docked at the ISS. However, its origins began in 1984 when President Ronald Reagan signed the 
Commercial Space Launch Act, which allowed private companies to work with NASA on space technology. In 1990, the Launch Services Purchase Act, actually ordered NASA to use 
commercial companies for launch technology.

#### [Highly political opinion on the FedEx indictment: Please FedEx, Fight Back against Extortion](http://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrezza/2014/08/25/please-fedex-fight-back-against-federal-extortion/)
But wait, isn’t it the job of the Drug Enforcement Agency to prosecute Internet pharmacies that flout the law? That’s what FedEx thought. How are package delivery services – or insurers, 
landlords, or even utilities for that matter – supposed to distinguish between legitimate online pharmacies and fly-by-night operators? Have “know your customer” laws imposed on banks 
now metastasized into the forced deputation of all businesses to root out and deny services to anyone the federal government doesn’t like? Between prosecutions like this and the 
infamous Operation Choke Point, it seems that way.

#### [Silence may be just the thing we need: Your Brain on Silence](http://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/this-is-your-brain-on-silence)
Silence first began to appear in scientific research as a control or baseline, against which scientists compare the effects of noise or music. Researchers have mainly studied it by accident, 
as physician Luciano Bernardi did in a 2006 study of the physiological effects of music. “We didn’t think about the effect of silence,” he says. “That was not meant to be studied specifically.”     
He was in for a quiet surprise. Bernardi observed physiological metrics for two dozen test subjects while they listened to six musical tracks. He found that the impacts of music could be 
read directly in the bloodstream, via changes in blood pressure, carbon dioxide, and circulation in the brain. (Bernardi and his son are both amateur musicians, and they wanted to explore 
a shared interest.) “During almost all sorts of music, there was a physiological change compatible with a condition of arousal,” he explains.     
This effect made sense, given that active listening requires alertness and attention. But the more striking finding appeared between musical tracks. Bernardi and his colleagues 
discovered that randomly inserted stretches of silence also had a drastic effect, but in the opposite direction. In fact, two-minute silent pauses proved far more relaxing than either 
“relaxing” music or a longer silence played before the experiment started.
