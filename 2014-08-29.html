Reasons Boeing's Stock Could Rise.</a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp; Wait. What?&nbsp; </span><a style="font-family: Calibri;" href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/25/3-reasons-boeings-stock-could-fall.aspx">Three
Reasons Boeing's Stock Could Fall.</a><br>

<span style="font-family: Avenir Light; font-weight: bold;">They like
you! They really like you, Boeing!</span><br style="font-family: Avenir Light;">

<span style="font-family: Avenir Light;">There are a lot of good
reasons to think that Boeing stock will remain popular with -- and
reward -- investors over the long term. Reason No. 1: The fact that
Boeing planes are so popular with fliers. Last year, flyer information
website Airfarewatchdog.com&nbsp; released a survey of 1,000 frequent
fliers, asking them which planes, out of all the planes built by all
the manufacturers in the world, they most enjoy flying on. The result
was "Boeings," by a nautical mile .</span><br style="font-family: Avenir Light;">

<span style="font-family: Avenir Light;">According to Airfarewatchdog,
nearly three in four respondents polled said they'd rather travel with
Boeing than in competing models from Boeing rivals Airbus or Embraer.
Indeed, out of the top seven planes ranked by fliers, six of them were
Boeings. Here they are in order:</span><br style="font-family: Avenir Light;">


<ul style="font-family: Avenir Light;">
  <big>
  </big><li>Boeing 777 (in first place)</li><big>
  </big><li>Boeing 747 (in second)</li><big>
  </big><li>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner (skipping a beat to land at
fourth place)</li><big>
  </big><li>And followed in quick succession by the Boeing 737, 767,
and 757, in that order</li><big>
  </big>
</ul>

</span></p>

<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dreamliner
still a nightmare</span><br>
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner passenger aircraft is a marvel of
technology, featuring&nbsp; 21st Century composite materials,
fuel-efficient engines, advanced fly by-wire controls, and bright LED
lighting and larger windows for passenger comfort. There's just one
downside to the plane...<br>

From time to time, it catches on fire.<br>

Actually, no. Come to think of it, while the occasional onboard bonfire
is the most high-profile problem the 787 has experienced, the new
aircraft has experienced a few other bumps in the road to widespread
adoption. Over the past couple years, reports have filtered in of
electrical problems in auxiliary flight systems aboard 787s operated by
Qatar Air and United Air Lines (NYSE: UAL&nbsp; ) , oil leaks and
cracks in windows and engine casings at All Nippon Airways.<br>

For a time, it seemed like customer complaints were dying down. But
then, just last week, we learned that one of the two engines powering a
Thomson Airways 787 en route from the Dominican Republic to England
abruptly stopped working -- while the plane was hung out over the
middle of Atlantic Ocean. It took four hours of nerve-wracking flight
on only one engine, over open water, before the plane could be brought
to rest -- safely -- at a Portuguese military base in the Azores.</p>

<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;">Carbon fiber used to make
Boeing Co. 787s will be used to make shoulder pads for football
players, Boeing said.<br>

Boeing (NYSE: BA) said that it's signed a deal with athletic company
Russell Brands LLC, with Russell using Boeing's surplus carbon fiber in
its CarbonTek football shoulder pad system.<br>

Boeing said it's using more carbon fiber in building its planes these
days, including building the 787 using half carbon fiber.<br>

"Our collaboration with Russell Athletic &#8206;is a fabulous opportunity to
utilize the strength and lightweight characteristics of 787 carbon
fiber to support elite athletes on the field," said Julie Felgar,
managing director of Boeing Commercial Airplanes environmental
strategy, in a statement.</p>

Program</span></a><br>

<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;"><small><img style="width: 285px; height: 169px;" alt="Google Secret Drone" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/08/thedrop/b55791b9f.jpg" align="left" hspace="12"><big>A man named Neil Parfitt is standing in a
field on a cattle ranch outside Warwick, Australia. A white vehicle
appears above the trees, a tiny plane a bit bigger than a seagull. It
glides towards Parfitt, pitches upwards to a vertical position, and
hovers near him, a couple hundred feet in the air. From its belly, a
package comes tumbling downward, connected by a thin line to the
vehicle itself. Right before the delivery hits the ground, it slows,
hitting the earth with a tap. The delivery slows, almost imperceptibly,
just before it hits the ground, hardly kicking up any dust. A small
rectangular module on the end of the line detaches the payload, and
ascends back up the vehicle, locking into place beneath the nose. As
the wing returns to flying posture and zips back to its launch point
half a mile away, Parfitt walks over to the package, opens it up, and
extracts some treats for his dogs.</big></small></p>

<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;">The Australian test flight
and 30 others like it conducted in mid-August are the culmination of
the first phase of Project Wing, a secret drone program that&#8217;s been
running for two years at Google X, the company&#8217;s whoa-inducing,
long-range research lab.</p>

how the Internet of Things effects Enterprise Networks</a><br>
</span>
<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;">Since most organisations
currently have no dedicated network infrastructure in place for IoT
devices, the majority relegate their &#8220;things&#8221; to existing networks.
Almost half of the organisations surveyed (46%) said that they planned
to simply attach these devices to their corporate network, while just
under a third (30%) claimed to have plans to create a separate logical
or physical network for this purpose.<br>

<img style="width: 438px; height: 310px;" alt="" src="http://www.information-age.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_landscape/public/field/image/shutterstock_144591986.jpg" align="right" hspace="12"><br>

</p>

<p style="font-family: Avenir Light;">Conversations with
Infoblox customers at recent panel discussions provided additional
evidence that most companies tend to just &#8220;dump&#8221; IoT devices on
existing guest wireless networks.<br>

But while these guest wireless networks will provide the devices with
the Internet access they require, they tend not to allow them to access
the internal resources they might need, such as database servers, file
servers and Domain Controllers. In addition, such networks generally
offer unpredictable performance, no prioritisation of traffic and very
little - if anything - by way of authentication, all of which are
considered necessary by certain categories of IoT devices.<br>

The reasons behind this treatment of IoT devices may be explained by
the survey&#8217;s finding that more than half of current networks (57%) are
already at full capacity. There does appear to be a level of concern
around this statistic, with 54% of administrators claiming that
management of their network infrastructure was considered a high
priority for their business.</p>

where they can tell me what happened at the end of "Lost".&nbsp;
Quantum theory proves that consiousness moves to another universe at
the time of death.</span></big></a><big><br>
</big></small>
<p><small><big><img style="width: 400px; height: 251px;" alt="Consciousness departs" src="http://earthweareone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/19.jpg" align="left" hspace="12"><span style="font-family: Avenir Light;">Lanza
is an expert in regenerative medicine and scientific director of
Advanced Cell Technology Company. Before he has been known for his
extensive research which dealt with stem cells, he was also famous for
several successful experiments on cloning endangered animal species.</span></big></small></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Avenir Light;">But not so long ago,
the scientist became involved with physics, quantum mechanics and
astrophysics. This explosive mixture has given birth to the new theory
of biocentrism, which the professor has been preaching ever since.<br>
The theory implies that death simply does not exist. It is an illusion
which arises in the minds of people. It exists because people identify
themselves with their body. They believe that the body is going to
perish, sooner or later, thinking their consciousness will disappear
too. In fact, consciousness exists outside of constraints of time and
space. It is able to be anywhere: in the human body and outside of it.
That fits well with the basic postulates of quantum mechanics science,
according to which a certain particle can be present anywhere and an
event can happen according to several, sometimes countless, ways.<br>
Lanza believes that multiple universes can exist simultaneously. These
universes contain multiple ways for possible scenarios to occur. In one
universe, the body can be dead. And in another it continues to exist,
absorbing consciousness which migrated into this universe.<br>
This means that a dead person while traveling through the same tunnel
ends up not in hell or in heaven, but in a similar world he or she once
inhabited, but this time alive. And so on, infinitely.</span><span style="font-family: Avenir Light;"></span></p>
