<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you follow me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rrumbaugh">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rrumbaugh">Twitter</a>,
you know that the story of the "Marathon Monks" is one of my
favorites.&nbsp; In the age of viral video, the instant gratification
economy, and celebrity worship, it speaks to us of mental toughness and
a commitment to a cause that seems to be, and may indeed be,
impossible.&nbsp; And the cause has no benefit other than the desire to
accomplish something difficult, and thus be enriched as person.&nbsp;
The challenge is so difficult that in a bygone era, you would take your
own life rather than fail.&nbsp; So difficult, that in 400 years, only
46 have accomplished the goal.&nbsp; <br>

on Mount Hiei are the sober reminders of an era when commitment to an
impossible goal was admired.&nbsp; We still live in such an era, I'm
certain of it.&nbsp; Here is the story of the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/3-remarkable-lessons-on-mental-strength-from-the-marathon-monks">Marathon Monks</a>.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">During the first 100 days of running, the monk is allowed to withdraw from the Kaihogyo.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">However, from Day 101 onwards, there is no withdrawal. The monk must either complete the Kaihogyo &#8230; or take his own life.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Because of this, the monks carry a length of rope and a short sword at all times on their journey.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">In the last 400+
years, only 46 men have completed the challenge. Many others can be
found by their unmarked graves on the hills of Mount Hiei.</span><br>

"of a certain age" offer lots of commentary that bemoans the rise of
the latest technology:&nbsp; pictures of rotary phones; <img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 300px; height: 169px;" alt="Michael Harris" src="http://img.qz.com/2014/08/michael-harris.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">decrying
the death of print journalism, the decline in quality of network TV,
the rise of "viral video".&nbsp; As generations age, it was always
thus, but it seems more pernicious lately.&nbsp; In fact, today's adult
population is the last to ever remember the era before the Internet.
What angst we seem to feel! But as this generation, we owe it to our
successors to remind them of how it was before, but also not to fight
the changes that are both ubiquitous and irresistible.&nbsp; We all
share <a href="http://qz.com/252456/what-it-feels-like-to-be-the-last-generation-to-remember-life-before-the-internet/">What it Feels like to be the Last Generation to Remember Life before the Internet.</a></span><br>

you were born before 1985, then you know what life is like both with
the internet and without. You are making the pilgrimage from Before to
After,&#8221; he writes. It is a nice conceit. Harris, like your
correspondent, grew up in a very different world, one with limited
channels of communication, fewer forms of entertainment, and less
public scrutiny of quotidian actions or fleeting thoughts. It was
neither better nor worse than the world we live in today. Like
technology, it just was</span>.<br>

greatest machine ever made is not my sports car, but rather a 2000 year
old analog computer made by the Greeks.&nbsp; Known as the Antikythera
mechanism for the Mediterranean island of its discovery, it baffled
engineers for decades, still surprises for its accuracy and
sophistication, has launched its own research project, and has even
been recently recreated in Legos.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Today
it is believed that this instrument was a kind of mechanical analog
computer used to calculate the movements of stars and planets in
astronomy. It has been estimated that the antikythera mechanism was
built around 87 B.C and was lost in 76 B.C. No one has any idea about
why or how it came to be on that ill-fated cargo ship. The ship was
Roman though the antikythera mechanism was developed in Greece.&nbsp;
One theory suggests that the reason it came to be on the Roman ship
could be because the instrument was among the spoils of war garnered by
then Roman emperor Julius Caesar.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">X-rays of the device have
indicated that there are at least 30 different gears present in
it.&nbsp; British historian Derek Price has done extensive research on
what the antikythera mechanism may have been used for. It was not until
1959 that Price put forth the theory that the device was used in
astronomy to make calculations and predictions. In 1974, Price
presented a model of how the antikythera mechanism might have
functioned. When past or future dates were entered into the device it
calculated the astronomical information related to the Sun, Moon, and
other planets.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If
the Antikythera device was the greatest machine from the ancients, then
for certain the greatest machine for the next several millenia should
be the 10,000 year clock.&nbsp; Here in the year 02014, you can learn
why legendary computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis put aside
the day-to-day and takes the long view on society, technology, and
humanity.&nbsp; Here's the <a href="http://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>.&nbsp; And here's how it is <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/engineering-the-10-000year-clock/0">being engineered</a>.</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial Italic;">The year is
12011. Two hikers cut through a stretch of cactus-filled desert outside
what was once the small town of Van Horn, near the Mexican border, in
West Texas. After walking for the better part of a day under a
relentless sun, they struggle up a craggy limestone ridge. Finally they
come to an opening in the rock, the mouth of what appears to be a long,
deep tunnel.<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 400px; height: 224px;" alt="Clock of the Long Now" src="http://d3ct8f39dj9jhs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LabeledFaceHi.jpeg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>
As they head into the shadows, not quite knowing where the tunnel will
lead, the sudden darkness and the drop in temperature startle their
senses. After a few minutes the hikers reach a cool chamber dimly lit
from above. A tall column of strange shiny metal gears and rods rises
hundreds of meters above them. Steps cut into the walls spiral upward,
and the hikers ascend until they reach a platform. A black globe
suspended above depicts the night sky, encircled by metal disks that
indicate the year and the century.<br>
