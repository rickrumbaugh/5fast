<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although
we obsess these days about making aircraft lighter, speedier, more
fuel-efficient, above all else, making them more quickly than ever
before, we should remember that the revolution in air travel began long
before any of us started flying for work.&nbsp; In fact, the "world has been
getting smaller", since the first ad for travel appeared.&nbsp; We all know
that the golden age of travel disappeared long ago, if, indeed, it ever
existed at all.&nbsp; But for a moment, let's take the long view of air
travel and remember when the exotic land of Hawaii got so much closer:&nbsp;

still amazing to us that humankind ever found a way to fly. But it
especially blows our minds to think about people flying out to Hawaii
-- the most geographically-isolated landmass in the world -- in the
early 1900s.</span></span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">

<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">While the Wrigh</span><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">t
Brothers and Charles Lindbergh&#8217;s landmark flights are what we remember
most, the most romantic period of flight belongs to Pan American
Airways and its Clippers. The so-called flying boats took rich people
to paradise before the bombs of World War II interrupted the dream.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">

<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">A piece of this history is the
subject of an exhibition at Washington, D.C.'s Smithsonian National Air
and Space Museum, titled &#8220;Hawaii By Air,&#8221; on view through July 2015. It
looks at how advancements in air travel worldwide changed Hawaii&#8217;s
tourism, and all of Hawaii, forever.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Flights in Hawaii started in
the early 1900s, around the same time as they did in South Carolina for
the Wright Brothers. But it wasn&#8217;t until the &#8216;20s that inter-island
flights really became the way to see the islands.</span><br>
