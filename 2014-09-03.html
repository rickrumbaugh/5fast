<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></span><a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123457785/next-big-thing-preparing-internet-things-enterprise"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Preparing for the Internet of Things in the Enterprise</span></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8216;One
practical example is demonstrated within the healthcare sector,&#8217; says
Adam Diggins, technology evangelist and content development manager at
Toshiba. &#8216;Patients could wear devices that monitor their vital signs,
such as heart rate or blood pressure, and communicate this </span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">data to medical practitioners. </span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8216;Another practical application
could be the addition of sensors in manufacturing processes. When
faults occur, sensors can send signals to central systems, which can
save money for the manufacturers, who do not mistakenly sell faulty
goods, and improve satisfaction for buyers, who are confident that they
are purchasing a quality product.&#8217;</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">

<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Manufacturing and healthcare
are indeed two verticals that immediately stand out when you think
about the opportunities presented by IoT, along with retail. </span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">This is because these sectors
require a logistics and supplier network for the services they supply.
If the materials involved in those networks were IoT-enabled, they
could create more intelligent and efficient processes. </span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8216;The financial sector and
government will not draw as much return, as these sectors do not have
as many &#8220;physically moving parts&#8221;,&#8217; says Hans Zandbelt, senior
technical architect at Ping Identity. &#8216;But IoT will nevertheless be
beneficial in supporting functions such as IT and office automation.&#8217; </span><br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Though the Internet of Things era has only just started, it may already be broken.</span><img style="width: 400px; height: 266px;" alt="IoT" src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/ces-unveiled-2014-8.jpg" align="right"><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Like generals fighting the
last war instead of the next one, many companies working to build the
Internet of Things seem to be stuck in the smartphone and tablet era,
embracing approaches that will soon be obsolete, if they aren&#8217;t already.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Today, smartphones are
powerful hubs surrounded by less intelligent objects. Each device is
managed and operated from a few centralized data centers. This is not
yet a major issue as devices currently last only a year or two before
being decommissioned. The cost of managing data centers is limited in
duration and underwritten by a constant flood of replacement devices
with short lives.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Not so in the Internet of
Things era: an LED lightbulb has an expected life of 20+ years;
aircraft are expected to remain in service for decades; the average car
on the road in the US is now more than a decade old. Applying a
centralized cloud-based business model to these devices will mean
decades of expense without decades of associated revenue. At IBM we
already see clients that are struggling with device-related services
that have failed to meet revenue targets, but cannot be switched off
for fear of angering an installed base.</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">The premise of Shyp is simple by
design. The idea is to provide the next best thing to pure
teleportation. Download the app, take a picture of the thing you want
to ship, put in the address where you want it to go&#8212;and you&#8217;re done. No
bubble-wrap. No packing tape. No weighing or deciding between UPS and
FedEx. A Shyp courier just comes to your door within about 20 minutes
and takes the stuff off your hands. That&#8217;s it.</span><br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 330px; height: 233px;" alt="Shyp" src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140828-SHYP-177edit-660x466.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>

of the following have happened recently. Here's a quiz: Which of these
captured the most public attention and outrage?&nbsp; 1) <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-29/jpmorgan-hack-said-to-span-months-via-multiple-flaws.html">Hackers prowling the network at JPMC for two months without detection</a>; 2) <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101964168">massive credit card breach at Home Depot, possibly by the same group from the Target hacking</a>; 3) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/01/celebrity-naked-photo-leak-2014-nude-women">celebrity breasts revealed to the world</a></span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;"><br>
Hackers burrowed into the databanks of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and
deftly dodged one of the world&#8217;s largest arrays of sophisticated
detection systems for months.</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Home Depot may be the latest
retailer to have suffered a massive credit card breach, the company
confirmed on Tuesday, after a website reported that a large cache of
stolen data had appeared on black market sites.</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">For celebrities, privacy is
utterly nonexistent. You are asked intrusive questions about your
personal life. You can be photographed at any moment. Your family is
investigated, photographed or harassed daily &#8211; parents, children,
sometimes even siblings also losing any semblance of privacy simply
because you share the same blood or name. Celebrity is, in some ways,
an infection that is only marginally beneficial.</span><br>

time you enjoy some unagi at the local sushi bar, you may be
participating in the Internet of Things.&nbsp; Yes, the world need wait
no longer for... connected eels</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The
first pilot of the IoT aquaculture management system is being tested on
an eel farm in Gochang, South Korea this month. A set of sensors in
dozens of 20-foot-wide eel tanks wirelessly transmit data on water
temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen levels to a sensor hub (in fact,
the system probably works similarly to your smart home), which in turn
connects to SK Telecom&#8217;s LTE network using a machine-to-machine radio.</span><br>
