are tiny members of the Internet of Things, but are beginning to have
an impact in retail, with other industries to follow.</a>&nbsp; <br>

are taking the world of mobile by storm. They are low-powered radio
transmitters that can send signals to smartphones that enter their
immediate vicinity, via Bluetooth Low Energy technology.&nbsp; In the
months and years to come, we&#8217;ll see beaconing applied in all kinds of
valuable ways.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">For marketers in particular,
beacons are important because they allow more precise targeting of
customers in a locale. A customer approaching a jewelry counter in a
department store, for example, can receive a message from a
battery-powered beacon installed there, offering information or a
promotion that relates specifically to merchandise displayed there. In
a different department of the same store, another beacon transmits a
different message. Before beacons, marketers could use geofencing
technology, so that a message, advertisement, or coupon could be sent
to consumers when they were within a certain range of a geofenced area,
such as within a one-block radius of a store. However, that technology
typically relies on GPS tracking, which only works well outside the
store. With beaconing, marketers can lead and direct customers to
specific areas and products within a store or mall.</span><br>

launches a personal shopping service and continues the pressure on home
delivery services.&nbsp; Fascinating to see the churn in what seems
like a stable old business.</a>&nbsp; </span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Uber,
the controversial online cab and limo service, just launched Corner
Store, an experimental grocery delivery service in Washington, D.C. The
experiment is limited to two zones of the city, and is available on
weekdays from 9 AM to 9 PM.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The service enhances Uber's original business model -- which allows anyone to become a paid driver -- by turning its<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 250px; height: 123px;" alt="Get picked up right away" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/142887/image15_large.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
drivers into "personal shoppers." Customers can use Uber's app to order
drugstore items like diapers, gum, and shaving cream, and drivers will
make an instant delivery. There's no minimum purchase, delivery fee, or
tip -- the driver is compensated by Uber, meaning that the company is
likely running this experiment at a loss.</span><br>

<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Boeing
Co is expected to receive final approval on Thursday to build what
could be a Silicon Valley-style corporate campus as part of a major
expansion of its factory in South Carolina.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Boeing has asked officials to
rezone 466 acres of newly acquired land for use as an "Aerospace
Campus," with dining and other consumer conveniences more familiar to
employees of Amazon.com Inc or Google Inc than airplane factory workers.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Boeing, which tends to be
guarded about any future expansion, said there no immediate plans to
start erecting the new services, but it is not ruling them out.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The conceptual plan shows the
"maximum utilization" of the site "as potential future business needs
might dictate," spokeswoman Candy Eslinger said.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The new zoning would enable
Boeing to include restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, dry cleaners,
office supply stores, travel agencies, barber shops, newsstands,
convenience stores, and child care, health and postal facilities,
according to plans filed with the city of North Charleston.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

knows if a golden age of air travel ever really existed, but it sure
isn't now.&nbsp; Let's take a look back at the romantic early days of
air travel to Hawaii and the Boeing "Flying Hotel".</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 250px; height: 105px;" alt="Flying Hotel" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1968795/thumbs/o-CUTAWAY-CLIPPER-570.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">In
1939, a Boeing 314 Clipper took to the skies. It was the largest
airliner at the time -- with wings so big they could be serviced by
crew members on interior walkways -- yet still only carried around 25
passengers. Known as &#8220;flying hotels,&#8221; these new Clippers offered an
upper flight deck, lower passenger cabin, lounge that converted into a
dining room, separate men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s restrooms and even a swanky De
Luxe bridal suite in the back.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Yet with the bombing of Pearl
Harbor in 1941, all tourism to Hawaii was stopped by the U.S. military,
and so was Pan Am&#8217;s six year reign of the skies.</span><br>

in the world. The Swedish furniture company has been aggressively
ramping up its use of computer generated imagery in their catalogs.
Ikea's first CG photo was a Bertil pinewood chair in 2006. By 2012, the
Wall Street Journal reported that 25% of their products were CG. Today,
that figure has ballooned to 75%.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Yes, that means three out of
four things you see in an Ikea catalog are fake. The fixtures. The
furniture. The walls. The light. Why? It beats shipping endless pieces
of prototype furniture halfway across the world for photo shoots.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
