<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 300px; height: 200px;" alt="HEL MD" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c104a6aa85484279fe5958afd0300bb7/200706782/HEL+MD+hires.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">Boeing
has a pretty storied history with lasers and now its testing one that
can take out UAVs and rockets regardless of where it's installed. A
recent trial run of the tech was conducted in Florida under some pretty
grueling conditions (heavy fog, rain and wind), to prove that even a
lower-powered version of High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator -- HEL
MD for short -- is capable in a maritime environment. As Boeing tells
it, the firm exceeded all of its goals and successfully engaged with
some 150 different targets including drones and 60mm mortar shells with
its 10 kilowatt laser. Wired says that the energy beam is powered by
lithium ion batteries, and that the whole setup only requires a
diesel-backed generator to keep the wheels of war defense moving.
Meaning, running out of fuel, not munitions, is basically the only
threat the energy weapon faces.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Perhaps
most interesting is the fact that the armament isn't controlled by some
arcane set of switches and levers: an Xbox controller and a laptop do
the dirty work. The next logical step for the HEL MD? Upping the
system's damage with a stronger, 50- or 60-kilowatt laser. Naturally. <br>

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Boeing's
venerable 747 faces an uncertain future, as do the 767 and the 777
classic. Those older airplane models have threadbare customer demand.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Robots,
meanwhile, have slashed the number of people needed to paint a 777
wing, and more bots are on the way to automate other tasks.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">With
so many changes coming &#8212; from the Boeing Co. product line to the way
the planes are made &#8212; what will the Chicago company's Everett plant
look like in a decade?</span></span><br>

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Undeterred
by snow, rain, heat, gloom of night - and cheaper than ever. The U.S.
Postal Service is slashing prices for big retailers in a bid to wrest
holiday shipments from FedEx and UPS.</span></span><img style="width: 300px; height: 200px;" alt="USPS truck" src="http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/20/02/20/4203524/5/628x471.jpg" align="right"><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">For
customers shipping at least 50,000 packages a year, Uncle Sam's mailing
service will charge up to 58 percent less for its accelerating Priority
service, in some cases undercutting its for-profit rivals.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">FedEx
and UPS are none too happy about this. The Postal Service has a
monopoly on letters, they argue, and is raising prices on some
customers unfairly to subsidize big retailers. The Postal Service,
however, has another huge advantage they are past griping about: It
doesn't have to pay traffic tickets.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Cisco
Systems Inc. is off the hook in a California federal suit alleging it
orchestrated surveillance systems for the Chinese government that were
used to torture and persecute members of a religious group, according
to a Friday decision.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">U.S. District Judge Edward J.
Davila ruled Friday that the plaintiffs, practitioners of Falun Gong,
insufficiently alleged that Cisco&#8217;s Golden Shield network was connected
enough to the alleged human rights abuses, or that those abuses touched
and concerned the U.S. as directly as called for by the U.S....</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Research
led by experts at Harvard University shows technology can be used to
send a simple mental message from one person to another without any

<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Neuroscientist Giulio Ruffini
told the Today programme: "You can actually transmit information
directly from one brain to another brain without intervention of the
senses."</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">"The next step would be to try to find more powerful techniques to send more complex information," he added.</span><br>
