view the decision in our case as one that should be powerfully
influential in challenges to the use of independent contractors in the
'sharing economy,' " lead plaintiffs attorney Beth Ross, who filed the
first challenge to FedEx's independent contractor policy in 2005. After
that, similar challenges were filed in about 40 states.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The list of potential targets
starts with Uber Technologies and Lyft, both of which have been sued by
drivers who serve customers who use the "ridesharing" services. The
drivers contend they should be considered employees. Neither company
responded to requests for comment.</span><br>

the source.&nbsp; But this is catching some attention in the press, and
I'm sure, around the executive hallways at Boeing</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">A
worker at one of two Boeing 787 assembly lines in Charleston, in the US
state of South Carolina, contacted Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit to
share his worries about the "Dreamliner".</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The worker, speaking on
condition of anonymity, says "with all the problems reported on the
787, there's 90 percent that's getting swept away".</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">He describes the troubles with
the plane as "an iceberg". He claims only 10 percent of problems are
visible to the flying public, with the rest "hushed up".</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">"I've seen a lot of things
that should not go on at an airplane plant," the worker says. "It's
been eating me alive to know what I know, and have no avenue, no venue
to say anything."</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">In a statement to Al Jazeera,
Boeing says that "787 airplanes delivered from both South Carolina and
Washington final assembly and delivery operations meet the highest
safety and quality standards that are verified through robust test,
verification and inspection processes".</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

watchers may find that a documentary on the Dreamliner that debuts this
week on Al Jazeera English, like the 787&#8217;s smoldering batteries in
2013, produces more heat than light.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Like those powerful and
problematic lithium ion batteries, however, the documentary does raise
troubling questions and leave some matters unresolved.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8220;Broken Dreams: The Boeing
787&#8221; is likely to attract a lot of eyeballs both here and in South
Carolina, where workers at the North Charleston plant &#8212; recorded
without their knowledge &#8212; express some disturbing opinions about the
plane.</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fascinating to see this guy at the peak of his youth and his health, to watch the stress that he&#8217;s under when Roger<img style="border: 4px solid ; width: 250px; height: 167px;" alt="Wearable shirt" src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/24/fashion/24RUNWAY/24RUNWAY-master675.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"> Federer is handing him a ball,&#8221; David Lauren said last week, just days before the United States Open, which starts on Monday.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8220;You can actually see his
heart rate spike,&#8221; said Mr. Lauren, who has monitored those activities
remotely. &#8220;You can see his breathing.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Mr. Lauren, the executive vice
president for advertising, marketing and corporate communications for
the Ralph Lauren company and a son of the designer, isn&#8217;t cyberspying,
nor is he tricked out with some newfangled sensor providing access to
his subject&#8217;s inner workings. It&#8217;s the ball boy who will, in a manner
of speaking, be wired.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a href="http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/96459017341"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Roger Ebert reflected on the value of slowing down and taking a look at life -- and drawing what you see</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;"><img style="border: 4px solid ; width: 250px; height: 179px;" alt="Ebert Sketch" src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/9f4840afc767537b5ee185e3657dadc5/tumblr_nba6vo9UDZ1qz6f4bo10_250.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">The
break in our childish innocence comes the first time we use an eraser.
We draw a chin and think it looks nothing like a chin, and in
frustration we erase it. That&#8217;s it. Our bond of trust with our artistic
instinct has been severed. We will be erasing for the rest of our
lives. I speak here not of great and accomplished artists, for whom I
hold great awe, but for you and me, whose work, let&#8217;s face it, will not
soon be given a gallery show.</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">It seems to me Annette said
something like this: Begin with a proper sketch book. Draw in ink.
Finish each drawing you begin, and keep every drawing you finish. No
erasing, no ripping out a page, no covering a page with angry
scribbles. What you draw is an invaluable and unique representation of
how you saw at that moment in that place according to your abilities.
That&#8217;s all we want. We already know what a dog really looks like.</span><br>
