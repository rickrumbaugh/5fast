</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The
U.S. Postal Service has announced that it will deliver groceries on a
test basis for Amazon. In doing so, the world&#8217;s largest mail delivery
service<img style="border: 4px solid ; width: 225px; height: 150px;" alt="Amazon package" src="http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-09-10/0910-usps-amazon-970-630x420.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
is deepening its relationship with the influential e-commerce provider.
So much for drone delivery. Amazon&#8217;s (AMZN) Jeff Bezos has the USPS,
which handles 40 percent of the world&#8217;s mail and visits every address
in America six days a week, now delivering packages for the Everything
Store on Sundays, too.</span></small><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<small><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The news comes just as
the USPS is entering a new period of tension with its chief competitors
in the parcel space, UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). The USPS is lowering
its parcel delivery prices at a time when the private guys are
preparing to raise theirs. Clearly, UPS and FedEx fear that the USPS
will siphon away their customers. The deepening relationship with
Amazon virtually guarantees that. The e-commerce giant was miffed last
December when UPS and FedEx misjudged the volume of holiday packages
and ended up getting many of them to customers after Christmas. </span></small><br>

Boeing Co. calls a new documentary from Al Jazeera English about its
787 Dreamliner &#8220;as biased a production as we have seen in some time&#8221;
and called it &#8220;neither balanced nor accurate in its portrayal of the
airplane, our employees, or our suppliers.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The
documentary, which is entitled &#8220;Broken Dreams: The Boeing 787,&#8221; latches
on to previous problems with the aircraft &#8212; delays in bringing it to
the market and the lithium-ion battery incidents that led to the
plane&#8217;s global grounding &#8212; and adds in surreptitiously obtained footage
of employees at Boeing&#8217;s South Carolina plant discussing their
continued concerns over the Dreamliner&#8217;s safety.</span></span><br>

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">The
largest contract ever between Alcoa and Boeing, valued at $1 billion,
will have Alcoa supplying aluminum sheet and plate products to the
aerospace manufacturer.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">In
fact Alcoa becomes the sole supplier to Boeing for wing skins on its
metallic structure aircraft. Alcoa plate products, such as wing ribs
and skins, will also be on every Boeing platform, including the 787
Dreamliner.</span></span><br>

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">There
will be over 20 million devices designed to automatically relay
information over the Internet by 2022, according to Machina Research.
For most of these &#8220;Things,&#8221; traditional wireless Internet networks will
be a pretty poor choice. Wireless carriers such as Verizon (VZ) and
AT&amp;T (T) have dedicated most of their resources to building
advanced cellular networks that are designed to carry huge amounts of
data to and from smartphones. Maintaining a connection to these
networks burns through batteries, and wireless operators charge large
sums for monthly data plans.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">&#8220;The
connection solutions we have today weren&#8217;t built for the Internet of
Things,&#8221; says Thomas Nicholls, head of marketing for Sigfox. &#8220;They were
built for smartphones.&#8221;</span></span><br>

Internet is not ruining our kids' brains and it is not the death of
knowledge.&nbsp; More millenials read a book than older Americans</a><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">But according to a new Pew study, knowledge and the written word can&#8217;t be so easily defeated. Despite embracing<img style="border: 4px solid ; width: 250px; height: 188px;" alt="Books" src="http://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/bookshelf.jpg?w=900&amp;h=675" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
technology more than their elders, the study found that millennials
were more likely to have read a book, either in digital form or on dead
trees, in the past year than Americans over 30. Even more surprising is
the fact that more young people believe there is important information
that can&#8217;t be found on the Internet than their forebears.</span></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><br style="font-family: Arial Italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial Italic;">Of
course that doesn&#8217;t mean the youngins are more cultured than their
parents in every case. Americans over 30 are more likely to visit
museums or galleries and to read the news on a daily basis.
Nevertheless, the study runs counter to the stereotype of lazy,
hyperconnected, attention-defecit millennials, incapable of ripping
themselves away from Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat, and who
aren&#8217;t likely to read anything longer than 140 characters in one
sitting.</span></span><br>
