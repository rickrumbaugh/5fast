<span style="font-family: Arial;">We could use some good news. FedEx: 9% Growth in 2014</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">


<br style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ground segment riding the e-commerce wave</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Ground division is expected to thrive
on the back of e-commerce sales growth. According to FedEx, online
shopping the world over could reach $1 trillion by 2016, indicating
that there's a huge potential for FedEx to up its sales through online
shopping. The effect could clearly be seen in the fourth quarter with
revenue rising 8% over the year ago period to $3.01 billion, mainly
fueled by e-commerce.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Express looking up</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 280px; height: 165px;" alt="FedEx plane" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/144635/2_large.jpg" align="left">The Express segment's operating
margin has been rising steadily in the past few quarters, which is very
encouraging because it shows that the company's cost cutting plans are
bearing fruit. Aided by lower pension costs, operating margin inched up
to 6.8% in the fourth quarter from an adjusted 6.6% in the same period
the previous year. Express revenues were also up 2% due to higher
volume and yields.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">International growth</span> </span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The courier behemoth is concentrating
its investment, acquisitions, and specialized services in those regions
where business is showing signs of growth. The European market has a
huge potential for FedEx to tap into. In less than three years, FedEx
Express has unveiled 100 stations, on-boarded 3,600 employees, and
started intra-country services in 13 countries for increasing its
footprint across the continent.</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">More than half of the Boeing Co
machinists at its fighter-jet plant in St. Louis, Missouri, have signed
up to take voluntary buyouts, the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers said on Friday.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">About 1,300 of the 2,300 machinists
at the St. Louis plant had signed up for the plan by a recent deadline,
but not all who signed up will take it as some will reconsider their
options, the IAM said.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Boeing confirmed that it had offered
the buyout to certain workers who met eligibility requirements, and
that not all of the workers were expected to leave.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/09/this-internet-of-things-radio-is-the-size-of-an-ant/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We all know that Wi-Fi radio won't cut it for the billions of things in the IoT.&nbsp; This radio might.</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Engineers from Stanford and Berkeley
Universities have figured out how to make radios the size of an ant,
which have been created specifically to serve as controllers and
sensors in the Internet of Things.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The radios are fitted onto tiny
silicon chips, and cost only pennies to make thanks to their diminutive
size. They are designed to compute, execute, and relay demands, and
they are very energy efficient to the point of being self-sufficient.
This is due to the fact that they can harvest power from the incoming
electromagnetic signal so they do not require batteries, meaning there
is no particular lifetime associated with the devices.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">"We've rethought designing radio
technology from the ground up," said Amin Arbabian from Stanford, who
worked on the project. "The advantage of moving to this architecture is
that we can have the scalability we want." This means that they can
scale the technology to potentially thousands of devices within a very
dense area.</span><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">The first thing to understand about
the &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; is that it&#8217;s not about Things on the Internet.
It&#8217;s a code term that<img style="width: 200px; height: 311px;" alt="Book cover" src="http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sp-series-2-bs-copy1.jpg"> powerful stakeholders have settled on for their
own purposes.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">They like the slogan &#8220;Internet of
Things&#8221; because it sounds peaceable and progressive. It disguises the
epic struggle over power, money and influence that is about to ensue.
There is genuine internet technology involved in the &#8220;Internet of
Things&#8221;. However, the legacy internet of yesterday is a shrinking part
of what is at stake now.</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">Digital commerce and governance is
moving, as fast and hard as it possibly can, into a full-spectrum
dominance over whatever used to be analogue. In practice, the Internet
of Things means an epic transformation: all-purpose electronic
automation through digital surveillance by wireless broadband. In this
essay I&#8217;ll describe how this is likely to work, and what the major
players think they are doing to get there.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1928076/jetpack-for-runners/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Imagine a world where everyone can run four-minute miles, because everyone is Iron Man</span></a><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 356px; height: 200px;" alt="Jetpack man" src="http://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:mtv.com:9585716?width=1200&amp;quality=0.8&amp;height=675">When you think about it, it&#8217;s frankly
insulting that the year is 2014 and we&#8217;re STILL not able to fly around
on fiery jetpacks, like the Spy Kids&#8230;</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic;">But a team of researchers from
Arizona State University has brought us one step closer to that feat by
coming up with the raddest invention ever: A jet pack for running. The
contraption is called the &#8220;4MM,&#8221; because it&#8217;s designed with the goal of
having the wearer run a four-minute mile. It weighs a fairly hefty 11
pounds, and looks like a bionic backpack.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: Six Simple Rituals to Reach your Potential Every Day</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Drink a glass of water when you
wake up. Your body loses water while you sleep, so you&#8217;re naturally
dehydrated in the morning. A glass of water when you wake helps start
your day fresh. When do you drink your first glass of water each day?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Define your top 3. Every morning
Mike asks himself, &#8220;What are the top three most important tasks that I
will complete today?&#8221; He prioritizes his day accordingly and doesn&#8217;t
sleep until the Top 3 are complete. What&#8217;s your "Top 3" today?</span><br>
