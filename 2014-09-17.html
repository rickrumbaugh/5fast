<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing wins "space taxi" contract
worth $4.2B, partners with SpaceX.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Boeing teams with
Jeff Bezos(!) to compete with Elon Musk and SpaceX.&nbsp; Should be
epic.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and
other senior officials gathered today at Kennedy Space Center in
Florida to announce that NASA will resume human space flight in the
United States-- Boeing and SpaceX will be the commercial partners to
help transport astronauts to the International Space Station, and they
will launch from Cape Canaveral.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The total contracts are valued at
$6.8 billion: Boeing gets $4.2 Billion, SpaceX 2.6 billion. Crew will
fly on Boeing's CST-100 and SpaceX's Dragon.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">A joint venture of Boeing Co (BA.N)
and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) plans to announce on Wednesday that it
will team up with Blue Origin, a company run by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O)
founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new rocket engine, a source familiar
with the plans said.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Officials at Boeing and Lockheed
declined comment. No comment was immediately available from Blue Origin
or United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed venture that uses
Russian-built engines to power some of its rockets.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Candid discussion of the new business environment in the defense industry and how Boeing intends to grow a $33B business.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Since tacking charge of Boeing
Defense, Space &amp; Security late last year, Chris Chadwick has been
building a plan to transform the world&#8217;s No. 2 military contractor with
$33 billion in 2013 sales and more than 55,000 employees.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">His biggest customer, the Pentagon,
has been hobbled by budget cuts, crimping new starts as key aircraft
programs such as the C-17 transport and the F/A-18 fighter wind down.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Chadwick started rolling out a new
strategy last week that he hopes will transform Boeing and win major
competitions like the US Air Force&#8217;s Long-Range Strike Bomber (L-RSB)
program, in partnership with Lockheed Martin; the Navy&#8217;s Unmanned
Carrier-Launched Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS); and the Air Force
T-X future trainer effort. The strategy itself will be formally
unveiled next month.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As startups attempt to master home delivery services, the last mile still belongs to the titans</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The business models of those players
vary, with Amazon drawing on its own extensive inventory, and most of
the others obtaining product from existing retailers. What they have in
common is some form of expedited or same-day service, to feed
consumers&#8217; growing appetite for immediate gratification.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">All face the same tough question: Can
they make a profit? Same-day delivery is brutally expensive to provide,
if you don&#8217;t have an infrastructure already in place. It&#8217;s one thing
for FedEx or UPS to deploy an existing network to offer a premium
service &#8211; quite another for a newcomer to pay for the vehicles and
drivers to match it. Especially if the service isn&#8217;t tacking on a high
delivery charge to cover its costs.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Internet of Things is not so much about the things, as it is about the changes underway in the Internet itself</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The open approach to designing and
layering the protocols that make the Internet work ensured that the
Internet's architecture is robust and that it evolves in a tractable
way. The same approach to the problem is valid and desirable now when
we are starting to put ten to a hundred times more things on the
Internet than people. The good news is that we aren't starting from
scratch: many of the architectural layers and technologies already
exist on the web and can be adapted to work on IoT devices. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">With the widespread adoption of
modern microcontrollers (MCUs) in very inexpensive and energy-efficient
form factors, we now have the ability to make even the smallest
embedded device a first-class citizen of the Internet. The open
standards that support their operation have evolved to the point where
they can be deployed on constrained devices (and networks) in a secure
and robust way. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Internet of Things really only
becomes a reality when we connect things with services in a seamless,
secure and simple way. To understand just how big of a paradigm shift
this is, we can look back at the history of the web. The Internet
before the web was very much silos of solutions from the likes of
America On-Line (AOL), Prodigy and CompuServe, forming technology and
content silos very much like M2M systems.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From viral fame to litigation.&nbsp; Who, indeed, owns the monkey selfie?&nbsp; Because, lawyers.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Is the photographer inflating his
role in the photos, or did the monkey take the glamor shots on his own,
without any prompting from the human? Does it even matter? Does Slater
own the copyright, or is a photo taken by an animal in the public
domain? For that matter, is a painting by an animal in the public
domain? We asked a lawyer.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: 6 Simple Rituals to Reach your Potential Every Day</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. The 50/10 Rule. Solo-task and do
more faster by working in 50/10 increments. Use a timer to work for 50
minutes on only one important task with 10 minute breaks in between.
Mike spends his 10 minutes getting away from his desk, going outside,
calling friends, meditating, or grabbing a glass of water. What&#8217;s your
most important task for the next 50 minutes?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Move and sweat daily. Regular
movement keeps us healthy and alert. It boosts energy and mood, and
relieves stress. Most mornings you&#8217;ll find Mike in a CrossFit or a yoga
class. How will you sweat today?</span><br>
