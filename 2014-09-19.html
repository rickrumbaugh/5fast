<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Aircraft production rates are like wall street "whisper numbers" to the aerospace industry</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Airbus is studying whether to
increase production of the A320-family aircraft beyond the 46 a month
already targeted for 2016, with a decision possible by year-end, Airbus
Americas President Barry Eccleston told the Reuters Aerospace and
Defense Summit in Washington.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"If we're going to make that
decision, we would want to make that decision as soon as possible,
because the market's already there," Eccleston said.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing carefully announces rate targets, while planning for higher numbers internally</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing Co appears increasingly likely
to boost production of its top-selling 737 jetliners to 52 a month
starting in 2018 after the head of its commercial airplanes business
spoke about that possibility on Tuesday.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Our focus today would be around a
52-a-month rate in (737 production) somewhere in that 2018 time frame,"
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Ray Conner told an
investor conference held by Morgan Stanley.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Now, I can tell you that the demand
is there for those airplanes, significant demand. So I'm not
uncomfortable with the timing or with rate," he said.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The remarks, among the most explicit
by Boeing so far, further cement the widely held view that the
Chicago-based company is close to announcing another firm planned rate
increase for the narrow-body 737.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"FedEx has never forgotten what matters most to Wall St."&nbsp; And has been consistently rewarded.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">With shares now at around $154, up 7%
for the year to date, and trading at trailing price-to-earnings ratio
of almost 30, FedEx shares aren't cheap. Not only is FedEx's P/E seven
points higher than the industry average, according to Yahoo! Finance,
shares of rival UPS (UPS_) trade at a multiple that is eight points
lower. UPS, despite being larger by market cap ($89 billion vs. $43
billion), is outgrowing FedEx in revenue by more than 2%.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Even so, FedEx can still deliver the
goods. Patient investors can be gainfully rewarded with gains of more
than 20% in the next 12 to 18 months. Assuming the company can grow
revenue at a rate of 2% to 4% next year, the stock should reach $190,
helped by gross margin expansion and ongoing share buybacks.</span><br>

top 10 IoT projects.&nbsp; Can't wait for the connected loo, which by
the way, seems like it should be communicating with the connected beer
keg</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">There&#8217;s no doubt about it: the
Internet of Things (IoT) is influencing and changing the way the world
works&#8212;from new opportunities to collect and analyze big data in
industrial settings to advances in autonomous vehicles and everything
in between. If you&#8217;re a follower of this blog, you&#8217;ve read about how
Intel and our collaborators have used outstanding computational
performance and energy efficiency to improve manufacturing, how we&#8217;ve
expanded the conversation around self-driving cars, how IoT is creating
exciting changes in retail, how we continue to aggressively explore key
aspects of IoT technologies and implementation challenges including
security, and much, much more.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">IoT constantly surprises and delights
us. Who could have anticipated we&#8217;d be connecting IoT to wildlife in
Africa, or to something as simple as a freshly baked cupcake, for
example?</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Who owns the fake cell phone towers used to intercept voice and data?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">On August 29, Popular Science
published a map of interceptor towers -- surveillance devices that
masquerade as cell phone towers to intercept voice and data
transmissions from every cell user in an area. 19 of the interceptors
were found in the United States in August, and two more popped up on
September 5: one in Garden City, NY, and another in downtown Las Vegas.
They were spotted by owners of the CryptoPhone 500 device, a roughly
$3,500 ultra-high-end phone that allows ordinary, if well-heeled,
citizens to see surveillance invisible to standard phones.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Though the F.B.I. has been using a
basic mobile phone interceptor that tracks phone location, known
colloquially by the brand name of "Stingray" since at least 2008,
federal, state, and local officials have tried to say as little as
possible about use of the technology, even in court proceedings. This
angers civil libertarians such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who view the use
of interceptors without a warrant as an unlawful search. The
government's silence has helped generate an information vacuum filled
by conspiracy theory: one fringe news site recently claimed that the
interceptors are a source of "smart grid mind control" made possible by
"voice to skull technology."</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Express gratitude.</span>
Gratitude fosters happiness, which is why Mike keeps a gratitude
journal. Every morning, he writes out at least five things he&#8217;s
thankful for. In times of stress, he&#8217;ll pause and reflect on 10 things
he&#8217;s grateful for. What are you grateful for today?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Reflect daily</span>.
Bring closure to your day through 10 minutes of reflection. Mike asks
himself, &#8220;What went well?&#8221; and &#8220;What needs improvement?&#8221; So... what
went well today? How can you do more of it?</span><br>
