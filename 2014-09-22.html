<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Doubling down on FedEx: Fred Smith saved the company from his blackjack winnings</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">But in the first two years, primarily
due to rising fuel costs, the company found itself millions of dollars
in debt and on the brink of bankruptcy. Even worse, Smith's vital pitch
for funding to the General Dynamics board was rejected.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">When FedEx's funds dwindled to just
$5,000, Smith realized he didn't have enough to fuel the planes. The
company had already gone to many extremes, from pilots using their
personal credit cards to fuel planes to uncashed paychecks.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">So what's a desperate founder to do?
Smith impulsively flew to Las Vegas and played blackjack with the last
of the company money.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Amazingly, when he came back the next
week, he had turned the remaining $5,000 into $27,000 &#8212; just enough for
the company to stay in operation for another week.</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">Ventures, Boeing&#8217;s internal idea
incubator, has hired Steve Epner, Gateway Venture Mentoring Service&#8217;s
chairman, as the company&#8217;s first entrepreneur in residence.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Epner will start Aug. 1 and will help
drive a creative and entrepreneurial mindset by working with Boeing
employees develop processes for analyzing business ideas with major
market potential, said Boeing spokesman Robert Sterling.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Given
the politics about keeping Boeing manufacturing in Washington, it's not
surprise the the Everett expansion was fast-tracked</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The state and the City of Everett
said they would do everything they could to speed up the permitting on
Boeing's new 777X facility, and they've backed that up.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The state just signed off on a key
building permit for the 60-acre facility at the Everett plant. The
Puget Sound Business Journal reports a permit was approved seven weeks
ahead of schedule, meaning construction can begin about two months
early.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Everett Mayor Ray Stephanson spoke at the site a few weeks ago.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Besides cranes in the air, I like big, noisy and dusty projects," he said.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">MarioPremLuca. The billionaires of Cisco</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Cisco has spent on average $763
million to acquire each spin-in that these three men have founded, even
though Cisco was also the sole investor in each.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">How odd is this setup? Imagine if
Apple sent its stars like Jony Ive, Jeff Williams, Craig Federighi, and
Eddy Cue off to an Apple-funded startup every time it wanted to build a
new product like a music player, smartphone, or smartwatch, and then
paid them three-quarters of a billion dollars to own the product when
it was done.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tourism meets virtual reality.&nbsp; Now, wouldn't you like a trip to the beach right about now? (Sunburn not included)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Marriott Hotels isn&#8217;t the first
company you think of when you think of innovation, and it&#8217;s well aware
of that. &#8220;Marriott needed to build credibility with younger travelers,&#8221;
says Michael Dail, the company&#8217;s VP of global brand marketing. To that
end, in 2013 Marriott launched its &#8220;Travel Brilliantly&#8221; campaign to
attract new customers by positioning the company as modern and
tech-savvy. It worked with MIT&#8217;s Mobile Experience Lab to remake
flagship hotels as social hubs rather than a box of temporary bedrooms;
it re-designed lobbies to be upscale &#8220;greatrooms,&#8221; where people might
actually want to congregate. And this spring, after seeing what
Framestore and marketing company Relevent Partners created with Ascend
the Wall, Marriott approached Relevent to explore creating the first
virtual travel experience.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;The tech has been there for a while,
the application has been there, but now that it&#8217;s becoming accessible
and mainstream, we wanted to be the first to jump out there,&#8221; says
Dail. &#8220;We wanted something more immersive, more experiential, that
helps people connect with that feeling of what travel&#8217;s really about.&#8221;
After two months, Marriott and Relevent had hashed out exactly what
that immersive experience should be, and took the idea to Framestore.</span><br>
