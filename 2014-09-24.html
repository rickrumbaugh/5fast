<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">More Boeing jobs going to Charleston with the announcement of new research and technology center</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Chicago-based airplane
manufacturer said Tuesday it has leased a 104,000-square-foot building
at Crosspoint in Palmetto Commerce Park in North Charleston. The site
will be office and laboratory space for its new research center where
300-400 people will be employed.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"This research center brings our
technology organization and Boeing South Carolina closer together to
transition technology from research and development to our commercial
airplane and defense products faster and more efficiently," said Lane
Ballard, site leader of the research center and vice president of
materials and manufacturing technology for Boeing.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">When fully operational, scientists,
technologists, technicians and engineers will work at the center,
leading research and development efforts in automation and assembly,
systems installation, chemical technology, nondestructive evaluation,
composite fabrication and repair, and electromagnetic effects, modeling
and characterization.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Identifying a brand means getting excited about it, and is often visual. Take FedEx for example</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Here is another example of how
something else can capture and hold our attention and then cause you to
spread the word. By now, more and more people probably know that in the
FedEx logo there is a hidden embedded arrow between the "E" and the
"x."&nbsp; If you didn't know, check it out below.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">If you didn't know that and are
seeing it for the first time, there is a good chance that your first
reaction with be to think: "Dammit, there it is. I've never seen it. I
can't believe my eyes," and there is a good chance that that experience
of surprise will also cause delight and make you smile. It will also
probably cause you to point it out and spread it to people if you are
stuck in traffic and a FedEx truck is in front of you and you run out
of small talk with someone in your car.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This just proves that when Boeing says to "haul rocks" or "go pound sand", people do.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Snohomish County has given a Granite
Falls quarry permission to truck rocks, gravel and sand at night until
3 a.m. to keep up with the needs of contractors building the new Boeing
777X factory at Everett.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Threats from China prompt Boeing to create new cybersecurity center in Singapore</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"We&#8217;ve established this center to
address current and evolving cybersecurity challenges in the
Asia-Pacific region,&#8221; said Per Beith, director of Boeing&#8217;s Information
Security Solutions. "The risks to critical infrastructure and
governments worldwide continue to grow, and this center demonstrates
Boeing&#8217;s &#8211; and Singapore&#8217;s &#8211; commitment to addressing the cyber threat."</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Silicon Valley engineers, come and get your $250,000 salary</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">That's why the best software
engineers are difficult to find these days. In some ways, the most
bitter competition between tech rivals isn't for market share; it's to
hire these skilled workers, who can easily command multiple
$100,000-plus job offers replete with attractive perks and equity
packages. In an attempt to control the hiring market, companies like
Apple, Google, and Adobe were found to have illegally conspired on a
wage-fixing scheme, leading to a nine-figure settlement in April.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">So it is that one Silicon Valley
startup is trying out its own version of shock and awe to grab the
attention of the best of the best engineers. Weeby.co, led by a CEO
whose technical work is used on more than 2 billion devices worldwide
and who has advised more than 100 companies on fundraising, is building
an innovative development platform for social games and is offering to
pay its engineers an average salary well above market rate: $250,000 a
year, or a million dollars over four years, plus equity.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">So
at least we know that, if everything goes really badly, there's a web
site that will let you go all Edward Snowden on the world</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">'Dead Man Zero' claims to offer
potential whistleblowers a bit more peace of mind by providing a system
that will automatically publish and distribute their secrets should
they die, get jailed, or get injured.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;So what if something happens to
you?&#8221; the site reads. &#8220;Especially if you're trying to do something good
like blow the whistle on something evil or wrong in society or
government. There should be consequences if you are hurt, jailed, or
even killed for trying to render a genuine and risky service to our
free society."</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Now you have some protection. If
'something happens' to you, then your disclosures can be made public
regardless,&#8221; the site promises. </span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: 50 Life Secrets and Tips</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Cut out the crap</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We have a lot of crap in our lives
that is neither necessary nor good for us. The crap includes certain
people, emotions and habits. Take the time to evaluate the constituents
of your life to decide what needs to go.</span><br>
