<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Recent changes by the Chinese government open up the market for private delivery services</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">FedEx Corp said that it has been
working closely with the relevant authorities to obtain express
delivery services permits ever since the new Postal Law came into
effect. Regarding the further opening-up of the package express
delivery market, FedEx said it would be operating domestic business as
usual in China.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Sarna Yeung, partner of industry
consultancy Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, said local
accessibility of suppliers would be the main growth driver and urged
logistics companies to expand their domestic distribution networks in
the respective countries to reach as many end-customers as possible.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Accordingly, they must invest in new distribution hubs and delivery fleets to secure a good share of the market," she said.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Having conquered the skies, Boeing takes aim at the oceans, too.&nbsp; The company will be making underwater surveillance drones</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing and Liquid Robotics today
announced a partnership to make water-borne robots that can handle a
variety of surveillance jobs, ranging from hunts for submarines to the
detection of drug traffickers.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Silicon Valley's Liquid Robotics is
the manufacturer of the Wave Glider SV3, a $300,000 self-powered,
seafaring data center that offers customers -- until now, mostly
researchers and marine industry companies -- tools for investigating
the open seas for months at a time. SV3s have a hybrid propulsion
system that can drive the robot with either solar or wave power. Boeing
is the world's second-largest defense contractor.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The new deal is aimed at augmenting
Boeing's existing maritime surveillance systems -- airplanes like the
P-8 submarine hunter and the Maritime Surveillance Aircraft -- with
autonomous devices that can monitor the seas around the clock.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Not widely known as an IoT player, the secretive Amazon Lab126 is investing heavily in device technologies</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Tech firms like Amazon.com, Inc.
(NASDAQ:AMZN) are rushing to develop the Internet of Things as they
view Internet-connected dishwashers, thermostats, refrigerators and
other household devices that can monitor and &#8220;talk&#8221; to one another as
the firs wave of a continuing demand for more connected products and
services. Some skeptics say the benefits of the IoT are overblown and
it will take much longer to become the norm than most companies
anticipate.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The sources highlighted that Amazon
is in final testing of a simple wi-fi device that could be placed in
the kitchen or a closet that would permit customers to order household
products just by pressing a button. They also mentioned Lab126 is
working on a number of wearable devices.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
standards and the backend integration of the Internet of Things has not
been established yet.&nbsp; We're all racing to create the IoT "god
platform"</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">It&#8217;s tempting to look for analogy in
mobile phone platforms, where Apple was initially dominant and now
enjoys an extremely lucrative and influential minority position against
Android. There are some crucial differences, though. For starters,
adoption won&#8217;t be quite as easy; domestic appliances last for a long
time, and nothing consumers have seen yet makes connected laundry seem
appealing enough to justify early replacement of a washing machine. And
even in cases where replacement is relatively easy, the grandest
promises entail stitching everything into a seamless system &#8212; replacing
just the easy stuff can seem pretty lame.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Three questions are posed for the
CEO of a company that is making meat products and leather, not from
animals, but from cell culture.&nbsp; And the fourth obvious question
is: "Vegetarians, can you and would you eat this product?"</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">
Modern Meadow, a startup based in Brooklyn, New York, is aiming to
commercialize leather and meat products that are not made from
slaughtered animals but brewed in cell-culture vats. If it works, and
if the market embraces the resulting products, it would lead to vast
savings in water, land, and energy use associated with livestock
production.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: 50 Life Secrets and Tips</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Read Viktor Frankl&#8217;s 'Man&#8217;s Search For Meaning&#8217;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">This book details Frankl&#8217;s time in
Nazi concentration camps and how the experience shaped his view on
meaning and purpose in life. His account of the camps is extremely
detailed and riveting. His conclusions on life are both far-reaching
and relevant to life outside of captivity.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
