<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
I<span style="font-family: Arial;">t seems like the in-cabin technology
on aircraft has been slow to evolve.&nbsp; But the attention brought by
the Apple Pay announcement seems to be encouraging innovation
everywhere, including in flight.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Panasonic Avionics is introducing
EMV-compliant Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology in its
In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) systems. Passengers and crew will be able
to use NFC-enabled smart phones and cards to make high-value
transactions and purchases, synchronize personal data, allow crew to
check in and out of duty, among other capabilities. According to
Panasonic, there are already 200 million NFC-enabled phones in
circulation capable of offering mobile payments, and this number is
growing with the Apple iPhone 6 announcing it will use NFC for its
Apple Pay service. Panasonic hopes to integrate other NFC initiatives,
such as in baggage handling, check in and airport logistics in the
future. The company expects airlines will be launching the NFC IFE
technology in the summer of 2015.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

time paranoia is not a new thing.&nbsp; Take a look at how a Boeing
factory in Seattle was concealed during the Second World War</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Very ingenious &#8211; putting fake houses
and roads on the roof of the big Boeing factory in Seattle so that it
was not visible from the air.</span><br>

<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Let's face it: drones are here to
stay. Military drones and delivery drones have been in the headlines
day after day for the past couple of years. We're taking one step
towards the future, including self-driving cars, wearable technology
and now, flying drones that can deliver you what you order online. Just
last week, reports of Google beginning to touch on Amazon's territory
surfaced.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">A CNBC report said that Google's
plans to develop their own drone system was going to be called "Project
Wing". It also stated that Google was testing flights in Australia, the
preferred place to do any type of beta testing that's going to likely
involve being outside for 8+ hours a day. It has to be tough work.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">HP next week will launch its SDN App
Store, albeit a bit later than planned. The App Store includes HP,
partner and community-developed applications for HP&#8217;s Virtual
Application Networks SDN controller where customers can browse, search,
purchase and download functionality for their SDNs.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The App Store was initially targeted
for the first half of this year but was pushed out to extend betas and
bulk up support in the channel. From Jacob Rapp, global marketing
leader for HP Networking:</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"The HP SDN App Store is much more
than a simple portal -- our app store is a complete purpose-built
software ecosystem, which requires not just a set of APIs, but an
end-to-end model of solutions, support, services and sales for a true
integrated experience for our customers. With that, we wanted to ensure
that we had more time to work with our lead alliance partners and a set
of pioneer customers to conduct multiple betas around the word(sic) to
provide an experience that is enterprise ready. Also a core tenant(sic)
for success in this new style of distribution is the active involvement
of our channel partners, which required us to complete significant
back-office upgrades.</span>"<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wonderful
essay on computing icon and tragic genius, Alan Turing, and why the
Turing test is taking us in the wrong direction, and why the future is
man-machine collaboration, not man-machine equivalence.&nbsp; (Can't
wait for the Turing movie, The Imitation Game, starring Benedict
Cumberbatch, in November.)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite occasional breathless
headlines, the quest for pure artificial intelligence has so far proven
disappointing. But the alternative approach of connecting humans and
machines more intimately continues to produce astonishing innovations.
As the movie about him shows, Alan Turing's own deeply human personal
life serves as a powerful counter to the idea that there is no
fundamental distinction between the human mind and artificial
intelligence.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Turing, who had the cold upbringing
of a child born on the fraying fringe of the British gentry, displayed
a trait that is common among innovators. In the words of his biographer
Andrew Hodges, he was "slow to learn that indistinct line that
separated initiative from disobedience."</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I saw what you did right there, but, right now, I can't even.&nbsp; Because, you know, the Internet.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">First, let's define Internet speak:
It's the language of the Internet. It goes beyond keyboard-born
acronyms like OMG and LOL. This is about online trends in terms that
are known to pervade certain web circles. It's the reason articles like
"How to Speak Tumblr" exist, and how Weird Twitter can thrive in all of
its odd glory.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Internet is a lawless land, and the language it uses to convey that is experimental and ever-changing.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The transformation of the language of
the Internet is a natural reaction to communicating online, instead of
verbally. When speaking to someone in person, people can rely on
"extralinguistic cues [such] as facial expression and gesture to aid
meaning," linguist David Crystal writes in his book, Internet
Linguistics: A Student Guide. Those cues aren't afforded in writing,
and become even more varied across online platforms, such as emails,
blogs or chatrooms. It pulls from both written and spoken languages,
but "does things that neither of the mediums does." The online
community created its own amalgam.</span><br>
