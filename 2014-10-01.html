<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">FedEx borrows technology developed by Tesla to make delivery more efficient</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">FedEx runs such a massive
operation&#8212;it uses more than 47,000 vehicles and nearly 700 aircraft to
deliver about 4 million packages every day&#8212;that any systemic change it
makes to cut down its carbon footprint can have major consequences.
That&#8217;s why news that it&#8217;s using technology developed by a founder of
Tesla Motors to make its trucks way more fuel efficient is so exciting,
both for its investors and those who want the planet to breathe easy.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">FedEx is working with Wrightspeed,
the Silicon Valley-based company founded and run by Ian Wright, who
helped create Tesla in 2003. Wright is still all about electric
mobility, but his new company doesn&#8217;t make cars. It makes electric
powertrains to be dropped into existing vehicles. And it&#8217;s sold 25 of
them to FedEx for a pilot program.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
Boeing exodus from Puget Sound continues.&nbsp; Two thousand jobs to
move.&nbsp; The union is angry, vows action against Boeing.&nbsp; Is
this even news anymore?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing announced Monday that it will
consolidate its defense services and support work outside of the
Seattle, Washington area and into other Boeing locations around the
country where similar work already takes place.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The transition will take about three
years and will affect 2,000 employees. Some employees may move around
inside the Puget Sound region around Seattle. Some of the jobs will go
to Jacksonville, Florida, and Patuxent River, Maryland. Others are
headed to the midwest. Boeing estimates that 900 jobs could be added in
Oklahoma City and as many as 500 jobs in St. Louis as a result of the
move.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Most of the positions will be engineers and logisticians.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">***</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Boeing engineers union said it
will respond by calling on the Legislature to revisit Boeing tax breaks
&#8212; an accountability measure that union leaders say lawmakers failed to
do when handing over $8.7 billion in incentives to land the 777X
project late last year.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;The reality is that Boeing is the
chief benefactor of those breaks,&#8221; said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for
the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. &#8220;It
received them, and immediately turned around and started planning how
they were going to take more jobs away."</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">Federal Express Canada Ltd. (FedEx
Express Canada), a subsidiary of FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX), has announced
the latest phase in its comprehensive retail expansion across Canada.
An agreement has been reached with Super C, Metro Inc.'s Quebec chain,
to house full-service FedEx Authorized ShipCentres® within the majority
of the supermarket's 86 stores throughout Quebec. This agreement
represents the largest opportunity for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground
retail growth within Quebec to date.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"This agreement reinforces our
commitment to Quebec and our ability to connect Quebec's online
shoppers and small and medium business to the rest of the country and
the world," said Lisa Lisson, president of FedEx Express Canada. "Our
alliance with Super C embeds our points-of-access deeper in communities
across Quebec than ever before."</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
combination of the innovation and insight of a human, paired with the
speed and precision of a robot brings the most value to manufacturing</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">While the prospect of increased
automation will inevitably cause worries about disappearing jobs, BMW&#8217;s
Morris can&#8217;t foresee a day when robots will replace humans entirely on
the factory floor. &#8220;Ideas come from people, and a robot is never going
to replace that,&#8221; he says.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Still, robots on human production
lines at BMW and other manufacturers promise to transform the division
of labor between people and machines as it has existed for the past 50
years. The more traditional robots that apply paint to cars, for
example, work with awesome speed, precision, and power, but they aren&#8217;t
meant to operate with anyone nearby. The cost of setting up and
programming these robots has helped ensure that plenty of small-batch
manufacturing work is still done by hand. The new robots, with their
ability to work safely next to human coworkers, let manufacturers
automate parts of the production process that otherwise would be too
expensive. And eventually, by collaborating with human workers, the
robots will provide a way to combine the benefits of automation with
those of human ingenuity and handcraft.</span><br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;They could use the alias &#8216;Polly-O
string cheese&#8217; for all I care,&#8221; said a food services supervisor at the
Central Intelligence Agency, asking that his identity remain
unpublished for security reasons. &#8220;But giving any name at all was
making people &#8212; you know, the undercover agents &#8212; feel very
uncomfortable. It just didn&#8217;t work for this location.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<span style="font-family: Arial;">This purveyor of skinny lattes and double cappuccinos is deep inside the agency&#8217;s forested Langley, Va., compound.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<span style="font-family: Arial;">ICYMI, these updates to the
dictionary are totes adorbs!&nbsp; Except for the obvious
douchebaggery, that is.&nbsp; Oh well... YOLO, Dude!</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The English language is constantly
evolving. To some, however, that &#8220;evolution&#8221; might seem more like a
speedy descent to becoming a hot mess &#8212; a phrase that, by the way, no
longer needs to be put in quotes, because it now has an official
dictionary definition. On Wednesday, Oxford Dictionaries released a
list of the newest additions to its online edition, many of which
reflect the popularization of silly Internet slang. The noobs might
make the 2011 addition of &#8220;noob&#8221; look tame: This year&#8217;s new words
include the likes of &#8220;amazeballs,&#8221; &#8220;cray&#8221; (attributed to Kanye West and
Jay Z), &#8220;binge-watch,&#8221;&nbsp; and &#8220;neckbeard.&#8221;</span><br>
