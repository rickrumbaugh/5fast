<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The combination of big data and the Internet of Things is poised to transform the factory floor</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Extracting data during the
manufacturing process and implementing it in useful ways was definitely
on the minds of those at Connected Enterprise. &#8220;All manufacturing
plants would be into industrial automation,&#8221; says Paul McGreal,
engineering manager at multinational medical device company Boston
Scientific in Galway. &#8220;To survive in Ireland, you have to automate and
innovate. But now we want to know how to get data from these machines.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Already he can remotely access data
from the manufacturing floor and see how a particular machine is
working, which means he doesn&#8217;t have to be at his plant site. &#8220;Having
the equipment connected to the internet, I can easily connect from
home, do diagnostics, and fix it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t have to have
five or 10 engineers in there any more. I can base them remotely, to
cover a couple of sites.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">He says his company already has some
expertise in the area, &#8220;but the marriage between Rockwell and Cisco
will give us new instruments and equipment that makes this much more
powerful&#8221;.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cisco could offer 50% upside by splitting into "fast growing" and "slow growing" businesses, according to one analyst</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB51517841841143733463604580184141214517692</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The markets Cisco sells into are
massive and expanding, and its products are well-differentiated from
the competition. But the businesses require heavy spending on research
and development, which for now cuts into profits. Growth investors
don't mind waiting for rapidly rising revenues to turn into future
profits. Value investors would rather see the free cash flow today,
with much of it spent on dividends.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">By separating its fast-growth
businesses from the rest, Cisco could attract both types of investors
and unlock a higher price. A slow-growing "Cisco Solutions" business
would generate heaps of cash and pay handsome dividends while
protecting margins by reducing costs and buying out mature,
cash-generating rivals. Based on peer valuations, it would likely sell
for between three and 3.3 times revenue, or $22 to $24 a share,
according to Sue.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The fast-growing "Cisco Cloud"
business would focus its acquisition strategy on early-stage growth
companies. It could fetch 4.5 to five times revenue, or $9 to $11 a
share. Cisco also sits on about $6 a share in cash and equivalents,
after subtracting debt. All told, Sue estimates a spinoff could drive
Cisco's value to $37 to $41 a share, or 47% to 63% higher.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The cone of silence may finally be ready to descend on airline seats.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Faster, please.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The noise cancellation process of the
Quiet BubbleTM is similar to the noise cancelling headphones some
travellers lug around, but Silentium claims the cutting-edge patented
technology it developed can generate more than 10dB(A) noise reduction
&#8220;across the entire audio spectrum&#8221; and has special algorithms that help
the microchip, which generates the invisible bubble of calm, better
predict the noise it needs to cancel out.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Silentium has already developed the
microchip for the automotive sector and has recently introduced the
product to aviation at the Airline Passenger Experience Expo (APEX) in
Anaheim.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Silentium&#8217;s CPO, Yoel Naor, tells us
that the company is already working with aviation suppliers and OEMs to
integrate the chip into aircraft seats of In-Flight Entertainment
equipment. The system can be embedded in the seat for active noise
reduction, or to the public address system, cancelling out ambient
noise in the cabin, or embedded into the In-Flight Entertainment. &#8220;We
had project with an airplane seat manufacturer,&#8221; he says, &#8220;after the
APEX , we will have some more partners that wish to implement it in VIP
rooms, private jets and so on. But the main target is to bring it to
the Economy class.&#8221;</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">VMware poaches key executive. Cisco "livid" in response.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Dominick Delfino, a 14-year Cisco
veteran who was vice president of worldwide data center and
virtualization systems engineering, joined VMware on Sept. 22.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Sources told CRN Cisco is none too pleased about VMware poaching one of its biggest data center rock stars.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Cisco is livid about this," one source close to both vendors told CRN Friday.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Admit
it, you've want the invisibility cloak ever since you read the first
Harry Potter book.&nbsp; Well, it's getting closer. (With cool video at
the end of the article.)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The &#8220;Rochester Cloak&#8221; is only limited
by the size of the lenses, so, at least theoretically, you&#8217;ll be able
to hide almost anything but your shame.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The researchers said the device could
eventually be used to allow surgeons to look through their hands to see
precisely what they&#8217;re operating on, or grant truck drivers a peek at
their blind spots, which, while certainly practical, may be among the
least exciting uses for invisibility we&#8217;ve heard proposed. But then
scientists probably aren&#8217;t supposed to encourage diamond heists and
casino jobs.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dude.&nbsp;
Just posted a new selfie on the vlog, now I'm gonna chillax with some
dubstep.&nbsp; Wanna hang? Don't be a buzzkill, bro.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;This particular decade has been so
rich in new words, especially from technology,&#8221; Peter Sokolowski,
editor (7) at Merriam-Webster, tells L.A. Weekly. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Among the 5,000 new possibilities are digital (9) terms such as &#8220;hashtag,&#8221; &#8220;selfie,&#8221; &#8220;vlog,&#8221; &#8220;webzine,&#8221; &#8220;texter&#8221; and &#8220;geocache.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">But they aren&#8217;t all about bytes (10).
Bro culture will be pleased (10) with &#8220;chillax,&#8221; &#8220;frenemy,&#8221; &#8220;buzzkill,&#8221;
&#8220;dubstep&#8221; and &#8220;bromance.&#8221; Sokolowski emphasizes that dictionaries are
meant to be descriptive of real usage (6), so don&#8217;t judge him for
those. And we're also believers that language is fluid (9), so just
chillax, OK?</span><br>
