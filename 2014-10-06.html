<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">VMWare is building a dream team of engineers to knock out Cisco<br>
<br>
VMware just made two huge hires in its quest to disrupt Cisco's $23 billion network equipment kingdom.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">It just hired Guido Appenzeller away
from the network startup he co-founded, Big Switch Networks. And it
nabbed Dom Delfino, who was formerly running the Cisco's sales engineer
team for Cisco's all important "Application Centric Infrastructure."
That's the product that Cisco hopes will stem off VMware's invasion.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">To recap: Cisco and VMware are in an
epic battle right now that promises to upend the way companies build
corporate networks. Cisco currently dominates this $50 billion-a-year
market, owning about half of it.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">John Chambers: Cisco is going to crush VMWare (from May, 2014)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">A cheerful John Chambers told Wall
Street analysts on Wednesday that his plan to crush his biggest threat,
a new technology led by VMware, is working well.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The network industry, where Cisco
dominates, is at the cusp of a huge change called software-defined
networking. That's where the high-end features built into expensive
routers and switches are put into software that can run on cheap,
commodity hardware.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ever
fly through a lightning storm?&nbsp; Pretty scary, but fear not!&nbsp; Boeing is on it, and here's the lab where the tests for
lighting dissipation are done.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;Power Players&#8221; traveled to Seattle
to meet Boeing&#8217;s lightning guy: Rob Steinle, who along with a team of
engineers, literally makes lightning &#8211; a million volts of electricity
worth &#8211; and tests its effects on plane models.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;In here, we're learning where the
attachment [lightning strike] is going to happen so we can beef up the
materials in those areas, so we can be sure that they can sustain a
major lightning attachment,&#8221; Steinle explained from inside Boeing&#8217;s
lightning lab.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">As shocking as it may seem, lightning
doesn&#8217;t actually severely damage a plane. Jets are designed to shed the
electricity -- acting like an extension cord that channels the electric
current through the plane&#8217;s exterior shell without penetrating its
interior. And it&#8217;s Steinle&#8217;s job to keep it that way.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Email
is a daily battle, but is it worth it?&nbsp; You only have to look at
the US "moon shot" to get an appreciation for life without email.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Apollo program was massive in
size and complexity. It was executed at an incredible pace (only eight
years spanned Kennedy&#8217;s pledge to Armstrong&#8217;s steps) and it yielded
innovations at a staggering rate.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">And it was all done without e-mail.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">How did the Apollo engineering teams
manage something so complicated and large without rapid communication?
Fortunately for this particular group, an answer was available. It
turned out that a senior engineer at this high tech company had also
worked on the Apollo program, and someone asked him this very question.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Here&#8217;s how the Apollo engineer remembered working:</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<ul style="font-family: Arial;">
  <li>His team met from 9&nbsp; &#8211; 10 am, three days per week.</li>
  <li>They spent the rest of their time &#8220;actually working on solving this enormous puzzle of landing on the moon.&#8221;</li>
  <li>If someone got stuck and needed someone else&#8217;s input, &#8220;they actually talked to each other.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Uh, what was that you just said?&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">You would think that the two most
common filler words in English &#8211; uh and um &#8211; would be totally
interchangeable, being so short and sounding so similar. But we
wouldn't live in the Information Age if we couldn't crunch a heap of
data that says otherwise. </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This
restoration and digitization of the US government's largest photo
archive is wonderful.&nbsp; (Interactive map of the US at the link)</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The Farm Security
Administration&#8212;Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) produced some of the
most iconic images of the Great Depression and World War II and
included photographers such as Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Arthur
Rothstein who shaped the visual culture of the era both in its moment
and in American memory.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Today's image is the historic Liberty
Warehouse in Durham, NC.&nbsp; Today, just up the street from the
photographer's location is a skateboard park.&nbsp; The Liberty
Warehouse still exists but is being systematically renovated into
high-end retail and upscale condominiums.&nbsp; Times change.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
