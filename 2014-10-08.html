<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">What if that guy on the assembly line was actually a robot?&nbsp; And what if, one day, he just turned and slugged you?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">At a conference on collaborative
robots run last week by the Robotics Industry Association, Ostergaard
was one of several to voice worries that the rules would place
unrealistic demands on robot designers and operators.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The ISO&#8217;s update will, for instance,
include guidance on the maximum force with which a robot may strike a
human it is working with. Those limits will be based on research under
way at the German Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. One
part of that work involves using a machine to touch human volunteers
with gradually increasing force to determine the pressure needed to
cause the sensation of pain in 29 different regions of the body.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With an announced target of 52 planes a month, Renton expects greater hiring and increased pressure on the supply chain</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">This remarkable ramp-up &#8220;definitely
means both job security and ... more jobs for Renton and the Puget
Sound,&#8221; said Bev Wyse, the Boeing vice president who runs the Renton
assembly plant.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing&#8217;s decision has some risks attached, however.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">It assumes no downturn will cool
today&#8217;s hot market for single-aisle jets, which has brought Boeing more
than 1,000 orders for the 737 in each of the last two years.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">And it will require precision execution of a plan involving hundreds of global suppliers.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Good
news!&nbsp; Those "instant gratification", "can I get it tomorrow"
shipping guys have it all wrong.&nbsp; At least if you are selling baby
products.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">In Zulily&#8217;s early days, yes, the
company struggled to keep up with demand as customers &#8212; mostly moms
&#8211;bought massive amounts of baby products. In fact, Zulily&#8217;s growing
pains have been well reported, but today, a lot of those underlying
problems are going away with the addition of new fulfillment centers
and massive amounts of automation.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Still, he said
the public company&#8217;s goal is never to get products to customers as
quick as the competition. Even on Zulily&#8217;s best days, it could take
roughly 10 days to leave the warehouse and a few more days to get to a
home. Sometimes that&#8217;s hard for the investment community to fathom, he
admits.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Five
Wild Predictions for the Internet of Things.&nbsp; Well, actually, not
so wild.&nbsp; I just assume that pretty soon, I'll be able to Google
your kitchen oven and find out what temperature you use to cook your
meat loaf.&nbsp; Or I could just call, but really, what would be the
point of that?<br>
<br>
One prediction that's not in the Pew survey but is worth noting comes
from Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of both MIT's Media Lab and the
One Laptop Per Child Association. Negroponte thinks many IoT
predictions are "tragically pathetic" and laid out his vision of the
future at TED2014 in March.<br>
<br>
"We're going to swallow a pill and know English, and swallow a pill and
know Shakespeare. It will go through the bloodstream and it will know
when it's in the brain and, in the right places, it deposits the
information," he said.<br>

What does it actually mean, for Skynet to become self-aware?&nbsp; The
fascinating real life discussion of when computers become conscious.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">I think consciousness, like mass, is
a fundamental property of the universe. The analogy, and it&#8217;s a very
good one, is that you can make pretty good weather predictions these
days. You can predict the inside of a storm. But it&#8217;s never wet inside
the computer. You can simulate a black hole in a computer, but
space-time will not be bent. Simulating something is not the real thing.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">It&#8217;s the same thing with
consciousness. In 100 years, you might be able to simulate
consciousness on a computer. But it won&#8217;t experience anything. Nada. It
will be black inside. It will have no experience whatsoever, even
though it may have our intelligence and our ability to speak.</span><br>

manufacture of the Boeing B-17F (Flying Fortress) in December
1942.&nbsp; This was taken at Boeing Plant 2, which was located near
what is now&nbsp; King County Municipal Airport.&nbsp; More than half
the workers in the factory were women.</span><br>
