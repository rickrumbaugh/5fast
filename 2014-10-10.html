<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Walmart wants to be your doctor</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The clinics, it says, can offer a
broader range of services, like chronic disease management, than the
100 or so acute care clinics leased by hospital operators at Walmarts
across the country. Unlike CVS or Walgreens, which also offer some
similar services, or Costco, which offers eye care, Walmart is
marketing itself as a primary medical provider.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Walmart wants to be your bank</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Now, one such deal, with Green Dot,
has enabled Walmart to offer its often low-income and downwardly-mobile
customers a basic checking account, outfoxing the big banks that have
tried but failed to figure out how to profitably enter that market.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Rest assured, it&#8217;s a gigantic
one&#8212;around 10 million &#8220;unbanked&#8221; Americans and growing. Not only does
Walmart think it&#8217;s sitting on a gold mine. It needs that added cash.
After food stamp usage hit record-breaking numbers in 2013, Congress
tried to pare back the benefit. Although a regulatory loophole allowed
all but a few states to evade tighter eligibility requirements, the
moves still hurt Walmart&#8217;s bottom line.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Amazon wants to be your Walmart<br>
In a big shift from Amazon.com&#8217;s long-standing business model&#8211;which has
relied on on-line sales and remote warehouses to compete effectively
against major discount retailers like Wal-Mart&#8212;the company is to open
its first physical store on 34th St in Manhattan, across from the
Empire State Building, according to a CNBC report.<br>
<br>
Though the store will function as a small warehouse and showroom rather
than a large retail store, Amazon&#8217;s move into physical retail space
represents a convergence between on-line and physical retail. In the
last two years,Wal-Mart has been expanding into the on line space by
acquiring online search technologies and building warehouses.<br>

<span style="font-family: Arial;">UPS has nearly 300 UPS Access Point
locations in New York City and Chicago with more locations being added
each week, and it is installing self-service smart lockers in
metropolitan Chicago. In January 2015, UPS plans to add all 4,400 The
UPS Store locations throughout the U.S. to the UPS Access Point
network. There are currently over 12,000 UPS Access Point locations in
seven European countries, and the company expects to have 20,000
locations in key markets throughout Europe and the Americas by the end
of 2015.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Workers using hand tools are being replaced by riveting robots in assembly of Boeing's 777X plane</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The robotic pulse production line,
known as the Fuselage Automated Upright Build (FAUB), will be the
baseline manufacturing process for the 777X and prior to that, for
assembling fuselages for current 777 models. The pulse line uses guided
KUKA robots equipped with end effectors to do the riveting currently
performed by workers using handheld tools. The robots will work on the
forward and aft sections, installing up to 60,000 fasteners per 777
fuselage. This is the first time Boeing will use such technology to
manufacture wide-body commercial airplanes. </span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Internet of Sports Things</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The main technology fueling these
innovations involving sports is similar to that which fuels the
Internet of Things as a whole. Sensors that measure everything from
temperature to altitude to stress levels have become much more common
in our world, but in addition to that, they&#8217;re also becoming smaller
and cheaper to manufacture. The technology to connect all these sensors
and analyze the data they gather has also advanced. One area where the
IoT is particularly noticeable is wearable technology. People are
already using wearable tech to track their fitness routines, so it&#8217;s
easy to see how this can be applied to sports. Sensors can be placed on
players to help trainers track their movements and progress. Sensors
may also become embedded within sports equipment, which can be used to
gather data on performance. For example, some Internet of Things
startups are placing sensors in items like baseball bats, golf clubs,
tennis rackets, and basketballs. From there, data can be collected to
determine&#8211;in the case of a baseball bat&#8211;how a player is swinging and if
the athlete needs to be corrected in any particular way.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Inside the eerie reproduction of Noah's Ark, in a Paris museum</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">As fas as museums go, especially in
Paris, this one is modest in scale. It&#8217;s pretty much one large room
with one exhibit. But what a room&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;high, high ceilings in a Belle
Epoque building, elegant green trim on the beams overhead. And what an
exhibit! There were no separate wings with tightly curated collections,
but rather a cavalcade of skeletons of every creature under the sun,
all lined facing forward, as if in a giant procession.</span><br>
