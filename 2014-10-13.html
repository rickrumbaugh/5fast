<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">FedEx demonstrates SenseAware technology, enters the IoT age.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Each critical SenseAware shipment is
accompanied by a multi-sensor device capable of monitoring precise
changes in temperature, relative humidity, light exposure levels,
barometric pressure readings, and sustained shock events.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;Supply chain in this age of IoT is
no longer just about cost and speed, but also information,&#8221; said Chu.
&#8220;With SenseAware, we are redefining shipment monitoring by providing
unmatched and near real-time visibility into shipments at every step of
the way, empowering our clients with the ability to make smarter and
timelier decisions in navigating today's increasingly complex and
global supply chains,&#8221; said Chu.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the most politically visible companies, Boeing attracts love and hate, from both sides of the political fence.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;There is an undercurrent of
disappointment that rises in some folks (including me) to the point of
anger at Boeing,&#8221; state Sen. Adam Kline, whose district lies just north
of one of the company&#8217;s major production facilities, said in an email.
&#8220;This is the way Boeing thanked us, by placing the 777X in the Midwest.
We&#8217;ve been had.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Like Boeing, Airbus knows it needs to build more planes, but is unable to say when, or how many.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Asked whether Airbus planned to match
its U.S. rival by adding to its own production goal of 46 A320-family
aircraft a month by 2016, compared with 42 a month now, Fabrice Bregier
said, "We have a slightly different strategy but the same vision: the
market requires a rate increase."</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Bregier, who is chief executive of
the main planemaking subsidiary of Airbus Group, added: "We announce a
rate increase when we know that our backlog is strong enough to do it.
We will continue, we will go through this transition to the A320neo. If
we can sell more aircraft we will be pleased to do that but it is not
the time for us to announce additional rate increases."</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Citigroup
is looking for developers to build IoT apps in support of
wearables.&nbsp; Here's hoping that pretty soon we'll be able to pay
for dinner with our shirt sleeve.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Citigroup Inc. is calling for all
interested developers across the globe to participate in its fintech
challenge to develop apps that will help the bank penetrate the
connected market, particularly wearable technology and smart homes.
Those selected to participate in the challenge will have access to a
set of APIs that would allow them to create IoT apps for the bank.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The timing couldn&#8217;t be better, as
Apple Inc. recently announced Apple Pay, a service that allows users
pay for good using their iPhone 6, 6 Plus or Watch.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;Money matters in people&#8217;s lives,&#8221;
said Heather Cox, Citi&#8217;s chief client-experience, digital and marketing
officer for global consumer banking. &#8220;Wearables will create a new kind
of demand that can be fueled by biometrics &#8212; think even safer payment
mechanisms with multi-layer bio-authentication as the security layer.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Time travel is possible.&nbsp; So, why haven't we met any time travelers?&nbsp; In search of the temporal tourists.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Time travel is possible&#8212;or at least a
lot of serious physicists say so. It's probably not possible to pull it
off in a souped-up Delorean, but there are wormholes, Tipler cylinders,
and other Einstein-inspired theories for how it could work. Which
raises the question: Why haven't we met any visitors from another time?</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">It sounds like a silly question, but
it's one that many scientists actually take very seriously. Meeting
someone from the future would, of course, serve as definitive proof
that we can indeed travel through time, and that would be a quite a
simple way to solve a huge scientific riddle. So it's no surprise that
a handful of enthusiasts and experts have staged experiments in order
to attract the time travelers that could be hiding among us.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">But wait!&nbsp; Maybe we have and just not recognized it.&nbsp; Take a look at the time traveling hipster.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From:&nbsp; 7 Things you need to stop doing to be more productive</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Stop working overtime and increase your productivity</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Have you ever wondered where the
40-hour work week came from? In 1926, Henry Ford, American
industrialist and founder of Ford Motor Company, conducted experiments
with interesting results: when you decrease your daily working hours
from 10 to 8, and shorten the work week from 6 days to 5, your
productivity increases.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Don&#8217;t say &#8220;yes&#8221; too often</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">According to the Pareto Principle,
20% of the effort produces 80% of the results; however, 20% of the
results consumes 80% of the effort. Instead of working harder, we
should focus primarily on those efforts that produce 80% of the results
and forgo the rest. We will have more time to focus on the most
important tasks. We should stop saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to tasks that bring low or
almost no result.</span><br>
