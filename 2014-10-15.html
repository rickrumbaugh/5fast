<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
J<span style="font-family: Arial;">ust another day, just another $5B order...from Indonesia</span><br>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Garuda Indonesia ordered 50 737 MAX 8
planes valued at $4.9 billion at list prices. Airlines typically get
discounts for large orders. The deal had previously been listed on
Boeing's website as an unidentified customer.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The airline plans to add 250 aircraft
to its fleet by 2025 as travel demand in Asia grows. Southeast Asia
carriers are buying enough planes to serve 600 million people,
according to Bloomberg.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">737 Max under construction.&nbsp; The factory is being built in Renton, and initial parts are being made in Auburn</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
In Auburn, Washington, Boeing has begun fabricating the first parts to
be included on the the first 737 MAX, set to fly tests in 2016, and
join airline fleets in 2017. The parts, called fuselage stringers run
the length of the fuselage structure giving it stability and strength.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">From Washington, the stringers will
be sent to Wichita, Kansas, where they'll be integrated into the 737
MAX fuselages, completed at Spirit Aerosystems. From there, they're
shipped by rail back to Renton, Washington for final assembly. </span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Battle
of the Titans.. Google begins delivery service, targets Amazon
Prime.&nbsp; Seems like this should result in greater volume for the
shippers, even if at lower margins.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Google Inc. is expanding its delivery
service and will start charging a membership fee, intensifying its
battle with Amazon.com Inc. for consumer spending.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Starting this week, Google will
charge $10 a month, or $95 a year, for unlimited same-day or overnight
delivery on orders over $15. Nonmembers will pay $4.99 an order, or
$7.99 if the order costs less than $15. Until now, the deliveries had
been free.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The service, initially named Google
Shopping Express but now known simply as Google Express, lets customers
place orders online for products from physical stores run by retailers
including Costco Wholesale Corp. , Staples Inc. and Walgreen Co.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">GE to Startups: Write apps for our industrial Internet of Things.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">GE has signed on Verizon, Softbank,
and Vodafone to bring Predix-based data to mobile devices. It&#8217;s also
partnered with Cisco to build rugged networking gear and with Intel to
make a reference architecture for sensors and other embedded hardware
that work with Predix.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">GE&#8217;s moves in the industrial Internet
are worth following because the company has a trillion-dollar installed
base of industrial gear that can benefit from instrumentation and
analytics. In 2012, it opened a software engineering center in San
Ramon, CA to develop its platform and has already made acquisitions in
the area, including one in an industrial security company. &#8220;We are
investing in small companies &#8230; and applying their technology to what we
do,&#8221; Immelt said.</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">So why is Microsoft doing research in
fundamental physics and quantum mechanics?&nbsp; Probably in their
quest to become the #1 IT company in the world.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Microsoft is now almost a decade into
that project and has just begun to talk publicly about it. If it
succeeds, the world could change dramatically. Since the physicist
Richard Feynman first suggested the idea of a quantum computer in 1982,
theorists have proved that such a machine could solve problems that
would take the fastest conventional computers hundreds of millions of
years or longer. Quantum computers might, for example, give researchers
better tools to design novel medicines or super-efficient solar cells.
They could revolutionize artificial intelligence.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Progress toward that computational
nirvana has been slow because no one has been able to make a reliable
enough version of the basic building block of a quantum computer: a
quantum bit, or qubit, which uses quantum effects to encode data.
Academic and government researchers and corporate labs at IBM and
Hewlett-Packard have all built them. Small numbers have been wired
together, and the resulting devices are improving. But no one can
control the physics well enough for these qubits to serve as the basis
of a practical general-purpose computer.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: 7 Things you need to stop doing to be more productive</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Stop doing everything yourself and start letting people help you</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">At some point in my career, I was
managing a very large community and couldn&#8217;t handle it. I tried to do
everything myself. I burnt out, but the community ended up taking over
and managing itself. Surprisingly, members did a better job than I have
ever done. I learned the power of community and why brands need
user-generated content.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Stop being a perfectionist</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;We found that perfectionism trips up
professors on the way to research productivity. The more
perfectionistic the professor, the less productive they are,&#8221; Dr. Simon
Sherry, a Dalhousie University Psychology Professor who conducted a
study on perfectionism and productivity, tells University Affairs
magazine. Dr. Sherry found a robust correlation between increased
perfectionism and decreased productivity.</span><br>
