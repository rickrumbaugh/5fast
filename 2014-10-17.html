<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 5 Fast Things</span></h3>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The US government has two space
programs, one public and well known, the other, secret.&nbsp; Boeing
X-37B returns to earth after nearly 2 years in space.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The X-37B spacecraft is roughly the
size of a small car. It has flown in space three times on classified
missions. After roughly 22 months in space, it seems that the latest
mission is preparing to come home.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">What is this mysterious vehicle
doing? Nobody really knows, and that's quite remarkable in these times.
Legions of amateur analysts track classified satellite launches. They
can usually work out the true nature of a mission by studying its orbit
and assembling other pieces of evidence. Thus satellites that are
designed to act as secretive eyes in the sky are normally unmasked
quickly.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The X-37B is different. We know it is
an experimental space plane that was originally owned by NASA before it
was transferred to the US Air Force. We also suspect that there's
something secret underneath the clamshell doors of its small payload
bay. But we don't know exactly what it is or what it is doing. Open
sources and technical analysis doesn't yield many clues. There has also
been no 'leakage' of secrets through whispers and gossip.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Boeing may never build another fighter jet</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Last month, The Wall Street Journal
reported on Boeing's plans to "concede the fighter market" to Lockheed
Martin, shift the focus of its defense business away from building
fighter jets, and focus on building "bombers, drones, and trainers"
instead.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The catalyst for this move was said
to be the fast-approaching end of F/A-18 fighter jet production in
2017, and the potential shutdown of F-15 fighter jet production lines
in 2019. As Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security head Chris Chadwick
explained to the Journal, "You have to face reality." And if customers
aren't buying Boeing fighter jets anymore, it's time for Boeing to exit
the business -- and focus on giving customers what they do still want
from it.</span><br>

<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Watch for Google, Amazon, and other
tech companies to have a greater presence this holiday season when it
comes to delivering packages. Both FedEx and UPS have already committed
to hiring 145,000 seasonal workers for the holiday months this year to
meet online shipping demand, but Amazon and Google are moving to handle
more of their own logistics, in part by leveraging their same-day
delivery services.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chicago: where "big data" can show you the density of the rat population</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"Our data scientist looked at this,
and correlated across space and time, and what we generate today is [a]
list that is updated every single day with addresses we think people
are going to complain within the next seven days," Schenk said.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Berman said that the recently
completed rat bait trial saw a 20 percent saving due to the efficiency
achieved through the prediction of the location of rat nests.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">"We're able to use that to direct city services in a more proactive way," she said.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Take a hacker to a cafe with public wifi and, well.... you can just imagine the stuff that you can find out about people</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">On his screen, phrases like &#8220;iPhone
Joris&#8221; and &#8220;Simone&#8217;s MacBook&#8221; start to appear. The device&#8217;s antenna is
intercepting the signals that are being sent from the laptops,
smartphones, and tablets around us.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">More text starts to appear on the
screen. We are able to see which WiFi networks the devices were
previously connected to. Sometimes the names of the networks are
composed of mostly numbers and random letters, making it hard to trace
them to a definite location, but more often than not, these WiFi
networks give away the place they belong to.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We learn that Joris had previously
visited McDonald&#8217;s, probably spent his vacation in Spain (lots of
Spanish-language network names), and had been kart-racing (he had
connected to a network belonging to a well-known local kart-racing
center). Martin, another café visitor, had been logged on to the
network of Heathrow airport and the American airline Southwest. In
Amsterdam, he&#8217;s probably staying at the White Tulip Hostel. He had also
paid a visit to a coffee shop called The Bulldog.</span><br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From: 7 Things you need to stop doing to be more productive</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Stop doing repetitive tasks and start automating it.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">According to a research study
conducted by Tethys Solutions, A team of 5 people who spent 3%, 20%,
25%, 30% and 70% of their time on repetitive tasks respectively reduced
this time to 3%, 10%, 15%, 15% and 10% after 2 months of enhancing
their productivity.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Stop guessing and start backing up your decisions with data</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">If you can optimize websites for search engines, you can optimize your lives to grow and reach your maximum potential.</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Stop working, and have do-nothing time</span><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Most people don&#8217;t realize that we&#8217;re
essentially locking ourselves in a box when we are too focused on
something. It&#8217;s important to walk away from our work once in a while
and have some alone time. Alone time is good for the brain and spirit,
according to The power of lonely , an article in The Boston Globe.</span><br>
