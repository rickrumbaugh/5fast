<p class="p1"><a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/americas-secret-weapon-space-behold-the-x-37b-11462">The US government has two space programs, one public and well known, the other, secret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>Boeing X-37B returns to earth after nearly 2 years in space.</a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>The X-37B spacecraft is roughly the size of a small car. It has flown in space three times on classified missions. After roughly 22 months in space, it seems that the latest mission is preparing to come home.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>What is this mysterious vehicle doing? Nobody really knows, and that's quite remarkable in these times. Legions of amateur analysts track classified satellite launches. They can usually work out the true nature of a mission by studying its orbit and assembling other pieces of evidence. Thus satellites that are designed to act as secretive eyes in the sky are normally unmasked quickly.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>The X-37B is different. We know it is an experimental space plane that was originally owned by NASA before it was transferred to the US Air Force. We also suspect that there's something secret underneath the clamshell doors of its small payload bay. But we don't know exactly what it is or what it is doing. Open sources and technical analysis doesn't yield many clues. There has also been no 'leakage' of secrets through whispers and gossip.</i></p>
