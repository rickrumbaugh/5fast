<p class="p4">On October 15, 2014, Harris County sheriff's officials in Texas reported that three people have been arrested, after a FedEx package containing illicit drugs was delivered to the wrong address. The unintended recipient opened the box and found cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. The resident notified authorities.</p>
<p class="p4">Instead of the FedEx package full of drugs they were expecting, a Texas trio received an unwelcome visit from the police. Search of the premises unearthed approximately $100,000 worth of drugs, described as “a hodgepodge of cocaine, heroin, LSD, steroids, assorted prescription drugs and a whole bunch of guns," including an AR-15 rifle with a full 30-round clip and a military-grade night scope. Scales, baggies and other drug paraphernalia were also found at the scene.</p>

<p class="p3">Driven by the airlines’ desire to cut costs and increase fuel efficiency, Boeing announced the 737 Max program in 2011 after contemplating–and ultimately rejecting–a completely clean-sheet design replacement for its 737 twinjet. Even before Boeing could finish the details of the Max’s design, the airlines, eager to boost earnings, began placing massive orders. Although Boeing won’t deliver the Max until late 2017, as of August it already has more than 2,200 orders for the airplane. The first BBJ Max is expected to be delivered without an interior in 2018 to California’s AvJet on behalf of a private client who currently owns a BBJ.</p>

<p class="p3"><a id="doc150"></a><a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/item/38787-the-x-37b-and-four-more-sec/">The landing of the Boeing X-37B brought attention to the company’s secretive Phantom Works division.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here’s four more reported aircraft projects.</a></p>
<p class="p10">All that is known about the X-37B is that this unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) had been a concept of US space agency NASA as far back as 1999, but after years of not knowing what to do with it, the craft was transferred over to the US Air Force with Boeing’s first prototype flying in 2010.</p>
<p class="p10">All of this secrecy behind the project goes back to the fact it is part of Boeing’s Phantom Works, which is responsible for all of the company’s most advanced and secret craft.</p>
<p class="p10">But what other Phantom Works craft has the company produced and what has happened to these very experimental planes?</p>

<p class="p3"><a id="doc152"></a><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/us-costco-wholesale-china-analysis-idUSKCN0I52TH20141016">By partnering with Chinese titan, Alibaba, Costco aims to avoid the mistakes of its US rival, Walmart.</a></p>
<p class="p4">"This shows Costco has learned from the mistakes made by companies like Wal-Mart and also those who were forced to exit the market like Home Depot," said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services at Colliers International.</p>
<p class="p4">Costco's decision to partner with Alibaba is designed to bring local credibility to the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer. China-based iResearch in July forecast sales of 2.76 trillion yuan ($446.6 billion) for the year, up 45.8 percent from 2013.</p>
<p class="p4">Costco is opening in China with its well-regarded and high-margin private-label Kirkland brand, which sells everything from men's shirts to laundry detergents, aimed at quality-conscious Chinese consumers.</p>
<p class="p4">Even so, price competition likely will be fierce with Yihaodian, a website in which Wal-Mart is majority owner. As part of an introductory "Shopping Spree" on Tmall, Costco offered four packs of Sensodyne toothpaste at 145 yuan, or $23.68, compared with 109 yuan on Yihaodian.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><a id="doc153"></a>For millennia, the Catholic church has been the steward of technology and automata, dating back to the earliest time pieces. Indeed, the Roman Catholic Breviary arose, in part, to mark the passage of time accurately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it makes sense that, in the twenty-first century, aspiring theologians continue the tradition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><a href="http://religiondispatches.org/automata/">At the Southern Evangelical Seminary, students wrestle with the most profound questions of humanity, accompanied by a 23-inch artificial life form.</a></p>
<p class="p15">Giving the impression of life, automata and robots push us to ask what it is about living beings that may be machinelike—and what, if anything, about life is distinct from a material mechanism. In the sense that SES is using a robot to explore deep questions, says Riskin, “there’s some continuity here.”</p>
<p class="p15">In a technical sense, too, D.A.V.I.D.’s lineage goes straight back to the church. Those Catholic automata gave rise to machines used purely for pleasure and amusement; from this broader automated tradition, craftsmen developed methods that would be adopted into industrial machinery and, later, the earliest computers. They may be distant relatives, but the mechanized Christs of medieval churches and the motherboards of a NAO robot share a family tree.</p>

<h2 style="margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial; background-color: #ffffff"><b>1. The world is ridiculous</b></h2>
<p class="p4">Objectively speaking, civilization is ridiculous. Next time you are at a scenic overlook or an elementary school Christmas pageant, take a second to look around and count the number of people who are experiencing the beauty of nature or the adorable miscues through small LCD rectangles instead of with their own eyes.  If that isn’t enough to convince you that our lives are ridiculous, consider the fact that it is customary for businessmen to tie a piece of cloth around their necks every day for no apparent reason, or that every suit they wear has a row of pointless buttons on the cuff. If you can stop and laugh at every day absurdities, you are two steps ahead of the game.</p>
<h2 style="margin: 8.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial; background-color: #ffffff"><b>2. Relationships are all that matter</b></h2>
<p class="p4">Time and time again when researchers have tried to figure out what makes people happy they have come to the same conclusion: personal relationships make the biggest difference. If we valued our happiness over money (as many of us claim to) we would do everything we could to spend time with friends and family and not worry so much about putting in extra time at work. When you look back on your life, you won’t reflect on the time you spent at work; you will remember family dinners, great vacations, romantic dinners, and your wedding. Prioritize people over your career.</p>
