<ul style="font-family: Arial;">
  <small>
  </small><li><small>Frequency: Three emails per week, MWF. No spam, ever.</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>Content: Material that I read regularly about customers and technology, all publicly available on the Internet</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>Links to original articles, but short excerpts that convey the point of the article in case you don't want to click through</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>1-3 items relating to  large enterprises and their business or use of technology</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>1 item on Cisco and/or Internet of Things, that you probably won't see on internal distribution</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>1 item randomly on productivity, leadership, technology, or 'weird science' that I think is interesting</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>Subscriber email addresses are known only to me.  That is, the readership of the email is anonymous.</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>Replies are sent to me only, but I'm interested in your opinions on the format and content.</small></li><small>
  </small><li><small>Format borrowed shamelessly from <a href="http://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings">Five Intriguing Things</a>, by Deputy Editor of The Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal. You should subscribe, it's an awesome newsletter.</small></li><small>
